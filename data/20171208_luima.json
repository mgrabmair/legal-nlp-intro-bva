Ferner, Counsel\n\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nThis matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (BVA \nor Board) on appeal from a March 1999 rating decision of the \nDepartment of Veterans' Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO) in \nLouisville, Kentucky which denied the benefit sought on \nappeal.  The veteran, who had active service from January \n1951 to February 1955, appealed that decision to the BVA and \nthe case was forwarded to the Board for appellate review.\n\n\nFINDING OF FACT\n\nThe veteran's claim for service connection for residuals of a \nleft eye injury is plausible and potentially capable of \nsubstantiation.\n\n\nCONCLUSION OF LAW\n\nThe veteran's claim for service connection for residuals of a \nleft eye injury loss is well grounded.  38 U.S.C.A. § 5107(a) \n(West 1991).  \n\n\nREASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION\n\nThe veteran contends that he sustain an injury to his left \neye during service when as piece of wire broke and struck him \nin the eye.  He testified that he received treatment during \nservice and that he currently has residuals of that injury, \nincluding decreased visual acuity in his left eye.  In this \nregard, service connection may be granted for a disability \nresulting from disease or injury incurred in or aggravated by \nactive service.  See 38 U.S.C.A. § 1110 (West 1991); \n38 C.F.R. § 3.303(a) (1999).  \n\nHowever, the threshold question that must be answered in this \ncase is whether the veteran has presented a well-grounded \nclaim for service connection.  A well-grounded claim is a \nplausible claim, one which is meritorious on its own or \ncapable of substantiation.  In this regard, the veteran has \n\"the burden of submitting evidence sufficient to justify a \nbelief by a fair and impartial individual that the claim is \nwell grounded.\"  38 U.S.C.A. § 5107(a); Grivois v. Brown, \n6 Vet. App. 136, 140 (1994); Murphy v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. \n78, 81 (1990); Tirpak v. Derwinski, 2 Vet. App. 609, 611 \n(1992).  In determining whether a claim is well grounded, the \ntruthfulness of the evidence is presumed.  See Robinette v. \nBrown, 8 Vet. App. 69, 77-78 (1995); King v. Brown, 5 Vet. \nApp. 19, 21 (1993).  If the evidence presented by the veteran \nfails to meet this threshold level of sufficiency, no further \nlegal analysis need be made as to the merits of the claim. \nSee Boeck v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 14, 17 (1993).  \n\nIn order for a claim to be well grounded, there must be \nmedical evidence of a current disability as established by a \nmedical diagnosis; of incurrence or aggravation of a disease \nor injury in service, established by lay or medical evidence; \nand of a nexus between the inservice injury or disease and \nthe current disability established by medical evidence.  See \ngenerally Epps v. Gober, 126 F.3d 1464 (Fed. Cir. 1997); \nCaluza v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 498, 506 (1995), aff'd, 78 F.3d \n604 (Fed. Cir. 1996) (table).  Medical evidence is required \nto prove the existence of a current disability and to fulfill \nthe nexus requirement.  Lay or medical evidence, as \nappropriate, may be used to substantiate service incurrence.  \nSee Layno v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 465, 469 (1994); Grottveit v. \nBrown, 5 Vet. App. 91, 93 (1993).  \n\nIn this case the veteran has testified that he sustained an \ninjury to his left eye during service.  As a legal matter, \nthis is a fact that is within the area of the veteran's \ncompetence to establish, and for purposes of a well-grounded \nclaim establishes that such an injury occurred.  As to \nwhether the veteran currently has a disability of his left \neye and whether that disability is related to the reported \nservice injury, medical evidence is necessary.  Obtained in \nconnection with the veteran's claim and associated with the \nclaims file are VA outpatient treatment records, some of \nwhich pertain to the veteran's eyes.  In particular, there is \na record dated in August 1998 in which the veteran relates a \nhistory of an injury to his left eye in 1954, during service.  \nFollowing examination the assessments were refractive error \nand presbyopia.  That record also contains a notation that \nthe decreased visual acuity is likely secondary to old \ntrauma.\n\nBased on this record the Board finds that the evidence \nnecessary to well ground the veteran's claim for service \nconnection for residuals of a left eye injury has been \nsubmitted.  There is evidence of the occurrence of a service \ninjury, medical evidence of a current disability and medical \nevidence of a nexus or relationship between a current \ndisability and the service injury.    However, as will be \nexplained below, the Board is of the opinion that further \ndevelopment of the veteran claim is necessary prior to a \nfinal appellate decision.\n\n\nORDER\n\nThe claim for service connection for residuals of a left eye \ninjury loss is well grounded, and to this extent, the appeal \nis granted, subject to the development requested below.\n\n\nREMAND\n\nOnce the veteran has submitted a well-grounded claim the VA \nhas a duty to assist is triggered.  This duty to assist \nincludes affording the veteran a through examination which \ntakes into account all of the pertinent evidence of record.  \nIn this regard the Board would note that the veteran has not \nbeen afforded an examination in connection with his claim.  \n\nThe Board would also note that the August 1998 treatment \nrecord referred to above specifically indicates that no chart \nwas available.  As such, it does not appear that the examiner \nwho provided the opinion that the veteran's decreased visual \nacuity was likely due to old trauma review the veteran's \nDecember 1954 separation physical examination which reports \nthat the veteran's distant vision was describe as  \"20/20.\"  \nIn addition, a VA treatment record dated in November 1998 \ncreates some question as to whether the veteran's decreased \nvisual acuity of his left eye is due to the injury he reports \nhe sustained during service.  That record notes that the \nveteran reported that he had had poor vision in his left eye \nsince an injury in the 1950's, but following the examination \nrecords an assessment of \"no apparent ocular pathology.\"  \nThe assessment also describes the decreased visual acuity of \nthe left eye as \"unexplained.\"  Under these circumstances, \nthe Board is of the opinion that an examination of the \nveteran's left eye would be helpful.  \n\nTherefore, in order to give the veteran every consideration \nwith respect to the present appeal, it is the Board's opinion \nthat further development of the case is necessary.  \nAccordingly, this case is REMANDED for the following action:\n\nThe veteran should be afforded an \nexamination of his left eye to ascertain \nthe nature and etiology of any disorder \nof the eye that may be present.  The \npurpose of the examination is determine \nwhether the veteran has any residuals of \nan injury of the left eye reportedly \nsustained by him during service, \nincluding whether any decreased left eye \nvisual acuity is a residual of that \ninjury.  Any and all indicated \nevaluations, studies, and tests deemed \nnecessary by the examiner should be \naccomplished.  The examiner is requested \nto review all pertinent records \nassociated with the claims file, \nincluding, but not limited to, the \nDecember 1954 service separation \nexamination and VA treatment records \npertaining to the veteran's eyes.  \nFollowing the examination and review of \npertinent records, the examiner is \nrequested to offer an opinion as to \nwhether the veteran has any residuals of \nthe left eye injury he reportedly \nsustained during service, and if so, \nspecify the nature of those residuals.  \nThe examiner should specifically state \nwhether any decreased visual acuity of \nthe left eye that may be present is a \nresidual of the service injury.  All \nopinions should be supported by a clear \nrationale, and a discussion of the facts \nand medical principles involved would be \nof considerable assistance to the Board.  \nSince it is important \"that each \ndisability be viewed in relation to its \nhistory[,]\" 38 C.F.R. § 4.1 (1999), \ncopies of all pertinent records in the \nveteran's claims file or, in the \nalternative, the claims file, must be \nmade available to the examiner for \nreview.\n\nWhen the development requested has been completed, the case \nshould again be reviewed by the RO on the basis of the \nadditional evidence.  If the benefit sought is not granted, \nthe veteran and his representative should be furnished a \nSupplemental Statement of the Case, and be afforded a \nreasonable opportunity to respond before the record is \nreturned to the Board for further review.\n\nThe purpose of this REMAND is to obtain additional \ndevelopment, and the Board does not intimate any opinion as \nto the merits of the case, either favorable or unfavorable, \nat this time.  The veteran is free to submit any additional \nevidence and/or argument he desires to have considered in \nconnection with his current appeal.  No action is required of \nthe veteran until he is notified.\n\n\n\n\t\t\n\tS. L.

Kung, Associate Counsel\n\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nThe Veteran served on active duty from August 1955 to July \n1959.  He died in April 2002.  The appellant is the Veteran's \nsurviving spouse.\n\nThis matter comes on appeal before the Board of Veterans' \nAppeals (Board) from a July 2003 rating decision of the \nDepartment of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office in \nLouisville, Kentucky (RO) which denied service connection for \nCrohn's Disease for purposes of accrued benefits.\n\n\nFINDING OF FACT\n\n1.  A claim for connection for Crohn's disease was pending at \nthe time of the Veteran's death.  The appellant submitted a \ntimely claim for accrued benefits.  \n\n2.  Resolving reasonable doubt in the appellant's favor, the \nevidence establishes that the Veteran's Crohn's disease was \netiologically related to active service.  \n\n\nCONCLUSION OF LAW\n\nThe criteria for service connection for Crohn's Disease, for \npurposes of accrued benefits, have been met. 38 U.S.C.A. §§ \n1155, 5121(a) (West 2002 & Supp. 2008); 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.310 \n(2008).\n\n\nREASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSION\n\nA. Veterans Claims Assistance Act of 2000 (VCAA)\n\nAs provided for by the Veterans Claims Assistance Act of 2000 \n(VCAA), the United States Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) \nhas a duty to notify and assist claimants in substantiating a \nclaim for VA benefits.  38 U.S.C.A. §§ 5100, 5102, 5103, \n5103A, 5107, 5126 (West 2002 & Supp. 2007); 38 C.F.R. \n§§ 3.102, 3.156(a), 3.159 and 3.326(a) (2008).  Such notice \nmust include notice that a disability rating and an effective \ndate for the award of benefits will be assigned if there is a \nfavorable disposition of the claim.  Dingess/Hartman v. \nNicholson, 19 Vet. App. 473 (2006); 38 U.S.C.A. §§ 5100, \n5102, 5103, 5103A, 5106, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.159, 3.326; see \nalso Pelegrini v. Principi, 18 Vet. App. 112, 120-21 (2004) \n(Pelegrini II).  \n\nIn a January 2003 letter, VA informed the appellant of the \nevidence necessary to substantiate her claim, evidence VA \nwould reasonably seek to obtain, and information and evidence \nfor which the she was responsible.  \n\nAn April 2006 letter provided the appellant with notice of \nthe type of evidence necessary to establish a disability \nrating and effective date.  See Dingess/Hartman v. Nicholson, \n19 Vet. App. 473 (2006).  This notice was not received prior \nto the initial rating decision.  In light of the Board's \nfavorable decision, the Board finds no prejudice to the \nappellant in proceeding with the issuance of a decision in \nthe present appeal despite any inadequate notice in this \nregard.  See Pelegrini v. Principi, 18 Vet. App. 112 (2004); \nQuartuccio v. Principi, 16 Vet. App. 183 (2002).  There is no \nindication that any notice deficiency reasonably affects the \noutcome of this case.  See Mayfield v. Nicholson, 19 Vet. \nApp. 103 (2005), rev'd on other grounds, No. 05-7157 (Fed. \nCir. Apr. 5, 2006).  \n\nThe Veteran's available service treatment records, VA and \nprivate treatment records, and VA examinations and opinions \nhave been associated with the claims file.  VA has provided \nthe appellant with every opportunity to submit evidence and \narguments in support of her claim, and to respond to VA \nnotices.  The appellant has not made the Board aware of any \nadditional evidence that needs to be obtained prior to \nappellate review.  See 38 U.S.C.A. § 5103A; 38 C.F.R. \n§ 3.159.  The record is complete and the case is ready for \nreview.\n\n\n\nB.  Law and Analysis\n\nUpon the death of a veteran, periodic monetary benefits to \nwhich he or she was entitled, on the basis of evidence in the \nfile at date of death (accrued benefits) and due and unpaid \nfor a period of not more than two years prior to death, may \nbe paid to certain parties.  38 U.S.C.A. § 5121 (West 2002); \n38 C.F.R. 3.1000 (2008).  An application for accrued benefits \nmust be filed within one year after the date of death.  38 \nC.F.R. § 3.1000 (c) (2008).\n\nThe United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit \n(Federal Circuit) has held that, \"for a surviving spouse to \nbe entitled to accrued benefits, the veteran must have had a \nclaim pending at the time of his death for such benefits or \nelse be entitled to them under an existing rating or \ndecision.\"  Jones v. West, 136 F.3d 1296, 1299 (Fed. Cir. \n1998).  The Federal Circuit noted that \"a consequence of the \nderivative nature of the surviving spouse's entitlement to a \nveteran's accrued benefits claim is that, without the veteran \nhaving a claim pending at time of death, the surviving spouse \nhas no claim upon which to derive his or her own \napplication.\" Id. at 1300.\n\nThe Board notes that a new revision to the law regarding \naccrued benefits claims, enacted by Congress and signed by \nthe President as the Veterans Benefits Act of 2003, Pub. L. \nNo. 108-183, § 104, on December 16, 2003, amends 38 U.S.C.A. \n§ 5121(a) by repealing the two-year limit on accrued benefits \nso that a veteran's survivor may receive the full amount of \naward for accrued benefits; however this revision only \nrelates to cases where the Veteran's death occurred on or \nafter the date of enactment, December 16, 2003.  It does not \naffect cases involving deaths prior to that time, such as \nthis case.\n\nThe prior version of 38 U.S.C.A. § 5121(a) provided for 1) \nperiodic payments to which an individual was entitled at \ndeath under existing ratings for decisions; or 2) periodic \nmonetary benefits based on evidence in the file at the date \nof an entitled individual's death and due and unpaid for a \nperiod not to exceed two years.  See Bonny v. Principi, 16 \nVet. App. 504, 507 (2002).  The phrase \"not to exceed two \nyears\" does not limit recovery of only those benefits that \naccrued in the two years immediately preceding a veteran's \ndeath; rather, 38 U.S.C.A. § 5121(a) (as in effect prior to \nDecember 16, 2003) limited the total accrued benefit payments \nthat a survivor may receive to those accrued benefits due and \nunpaid for up to a two-year period.  See Terry v. Principi, \n367 F.3d 1291 (Fed. Cir. 2004).  The Federal Circuit held \nthat section 5121(a) only limits a survivor's recovery of \naccrued benefits to a maximum two-year period of benefits \naccrued at any time during the veteran's life. Id.\n\nService connection may be granted for disease or injury \nincurred in or aggravated by active service.  38 U.S.C.A. §§ \n1110, 1131(West 2002); 38 C.F.R. § 3.303 (2008).  Service \nconnection may be granted for any disease diagnosed after \ndischarge when all the evidence, including that pertinent to \nservice, establishes that the disease was incurred in \nservice.  38 C.F.R. § 3.303(d) (2008).  In addition, certain \nchronic diseases, such as malignant tumors, may be presumed \nto have been incurred or aggravated during service if such \ndiseases become disabling to a compensable degree within one \nyear of separation from active duty.  38 U.S.C.A. §§ 1101, \n1112 (West 2002 & Supp. 2008); 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.307, 3.309 \n(2008).\n\nThe Veteran served on active duty from August 1955 to July \n1959.  At the time of the Veteran's death, a claim for \nservice connection for Crohn's disease was pending before the \nBoard.  The Board remanded the Veteran's claim for service \nconnection in April 1999.  The Veteran died in April 2002, \nprior to a decision on the appeal.  The appellant filed a \ntimely June 2002 claim for service connection for the \nVeteran's Crohn's disease on an accrued benefits basis.  In \nthis case, the Veteran had alleged in his original claim that \nhe had Crohn's disease, and that the disease originally \nmanifested during his period of active duty.  That original \nclaim has been reiterated by the appellant in this matter.  \n\nThe Veteran's service medical records contain a transmittal \nletter dated in early January 1959 from the United States \nPublic Health Service Hospital in Baltimore, Maryland to the \nUnited States Naval Hospital in Annapolis, Maryland stating \nthat the Veteran's health records, and clinical study results \nwere being sent to the Naval Hospital.  Further, they contain \na notation indicating that the Veteran was hospitalized at \nthe Naval Hospital in Annapolis for approximately three weeks \nin January 1959.  However, the medical records from the \nUnited States Public Health Service Hospital in Baltimore, \nand the United States Naval Hospital in Annapolis, were not \nfound.  The RO made a formal finding regarding the \nunavailability of such records in August 2006.\n\nThe Board notes the Veteran's service medical records are \nnegative for any diagnosis or treatment for Crohn's disease.  \nThe Veteran's separation examination in July 1959 was \nnegative for Crohn's disease, as was an October 1962 \nevaluation examination; a history of frequent draining \nabscesses was noted on the latter examination.  \n\nTreatment records from private physician L. C. M., M.D., \ndated in June 1961, note that the Veteran had a perineal \nfistula, and that he gave a history of having had a similar \nfistula in November 1960.\n\nA medical report from April 1962 referred to a history of \n\"urethral stones\" and a current diagnosis of \"pyelitis\" \nbased on abnormal urine findings.  In June 1962, the Veteran \nwas diagnosed with acute appendicitis and superficial \nperineal fistula.  In September 1962, the Veteran presented \nto a private hospital with complaints of severe pain in his \nright side, and a two week history of anorexia, nausea, and a \n20 pound weight loss without vomiting.  The hospital records \nnote that the Veteran complained of a history of similar pain \nsince 1957, as well as a history of multiple rectal abscesses \nwith drainage.  Two old rectal fistula tracts were seen.  In \nNovember of that year, the Veteran was seen following \ncomplaints of pain in his side.  A rectal examination \nrevealed no abnormal findings.  \n\nA handwritten note, apparently dating from approximately \nJanuary 1963, contained in the Veteran's reserve service \nmedical records, mentions that the Veteran was treated while \non active duty for numerous problems, including possible \ncolitis.\n\nIn November 1963, the Veteran was again treated at a private \nhospital for severe pain in his right side.  A July 1967 \nprivate report of hospitalization indicates that the Veteran \nwas admitted for an elective vagotomy and antrectomy.  It was \nnoted that the Veteran had been seen and had had previous \nadmissions to the hospital, and the established diagnosis of \nchronic duodenal ulcer with partial obstruction was noted to \nhave been made on one occasion.  It was noted that subsequent \nto that, the Veteran had been treated medically with no \nsignificant improvement, and hence, was admitted at that time \nfor elective surgical therapy for his chronic duodenal ulcer \nwhich at that time was classified as intractable.  The \nVeteran reportedly had been on medical management since \nOctober 1966.  \n\nA January 1968 private report of a gastrointestinal series \nindicated that the Veteran had a duodenal ulcer deformity \nwith indications of active disease but no projecting crater \nseen.  In an April 1968 private medical report of \nhospitalization, the Veteran gave a history of chronic pain \nin his abdomen accompanied by nausea and vomiting; he \nindicated the onset of such symptomatology as 11 years \nearlier or 1957.  It was noted that the Veteran had had \nseveral follow-ups of his ulcer.  His past medical history \nincluded a pilonidal cystectomy in 1965; abdominal \nexploration and lysis of adhesion in 1965; cystoscopy and \nretrograde pyelogram in 1966; right inguinal herniorrhaphy in \n1966; and right orchiectomy for seminoma of the right \ntesticle with postoperative irradiation.  The discharge \ndiagnostic diagnoses were chronic duodenal ulcer; status \npostoperative orchiectomy and irradiation for seminoma of the \nright testicle; and status post repair of right inguinal \nhernia.  During this hospitalization the Veteran underwent a \nbilateral subdiaphragmatic vagotomy, pyloroplasty and tube \ngastrostomy.  The preoperative and postoperative diagnosis \nwas chronic duodenal ulcer.  In a May 1971 private medical \nreport, it was noted that the Veteran's past history included \na chronic duodenal ulcer.   \n\nThe Veteran was admitted to the Pikeville Methodist Hospital, \nin Pikeville, Kentucky, in June 1979 with a provisional \ndiagnosis of possible Crohn's disease.\n\nA notation (review of symptoms: GI) in a private medical \nrecord dated in April l973 cites the following: \"S/P \ngastrectomy\" and \"colitis ('64).\"  Other private \noutpatient reports from 1973 through 1997 noted a diagnosis \nof colitis in 1964 and reports of abdominal pain and diarrhea \nand constipation in January 1975.  Abdominal masses and lower \nabdominal tenderness were noted in July 1975.  In July 1983, \nthe Veteran was diagnosed with Crohn's disease.  In January \n1987, low back pain was noted, as was pain when the Veteran \nate certain foods.  \n\nReports from East Kentucky Health Services Center show that \nthe Veteran complained of abnormal bowel movements in August \n1973 (constipation and diarrhea), abdominal pain in January \nand July 1975, and was diagnosed with Crohn's disease in July \n1983.  A note from August 1983 noted 7 prior abdominal \noperations.  \n\nMedical reports from Pikeville Methodist Hospital from March \n1979 through March 1983 show that the Veteran complained of \nbloody diarrhea with mucus.  A sigmoidoscopy was negative.  \nIt was noted that the Veteran had a gastric resection in 1967 \nwith a vagotomy for his chronic ulcer disease.  At that time, \nCrohn's disease was suspected.  \n\nA medical report from Appalachian Regional Healthcare in July \n1995 noted that the Veteran underwent a colonoscopy and snare \npolypectomy.  In August, a biopsy revealed mild microscopic \ncolitis.  A diagnosis of Crohn's disease, in remission, was \nprovided. \n\nThe Veteran was afforded a VA examination in December 1995.  \nA history of a 1967 distal gastrectomy was noted.  At that \ntime, the Veteran reported with intermittent diarrhea, \nconstipation, and abdominal pain.  The Veteran's diagnosis of \nCrohn's disease was noted, by history only.  As the Veteran's \nchart was not available for review at that time, the examiner \nsubmitted an addendum opinion in January 1996.  However, the \naddendum did not contain an opinion as to the etiology of the \nVeteran's Crohn's disease.  \n\nTo supplement the record, the Veteran, his brother, and the \nappellant had submitted numerous statements.  In July 1996, \nthe Veteran stated that he acquired Crohn's disease when he \nwas 21 and had surgery for a fistula in 1964.  That month, a \nstatement from the Veteran's brother noted that the Veteran \nhad exploratory surgery of his large intestines in 1964.  In \na February 1997 statement, the Veteran reported that he began \nsuffering with Crohn's disease at the age of 21 while in the \nNavy.  He stated that he did not receive treatment for this \nproblem within one year of discharge because he did not have \nenough money.  He noted that he had 7 surgeries from 1962 to \n1967.  A statement from the Veteran's brother, submitted the \nsame month, noted that the Veteran had a surgical procedure \nto remove a section of his colon, and that a definitive \ndiagnosis of Crohn's disease was not offered until 1983.  \nSeveral statements from the appellant are also of record.\n\nDuring both of his personal hearings, the Veteran testified \nthat the pain and other symptoms he experienced during his \nactive service, for which he was hospitalized in 1959, were \nthe same as those he experienced after his discharge from \nservice, which were ultimately identified as being caused by \nCrohn's disease.\n\nAlthough the Board notes that this is an accrued benefits \ncase, a January 2009 medical expert opinion shows that it is \nat least as likely as not that the Veteran's Crohn's disease \nhad its clinical onset during his period of active military \nservice.  See 38 C.F.R. § 3.1000(d)(4); Hayes v. Brown, 4 \nVet. App. 353 (1993).  This evidence is corroborative of \nevidence in the file at the time of the Veteran's death.\n\nBased on the foregoing, the Board finds that, with resolution \nof reasonable doubt in the appellant's favor, service \nconnection for Crohn's disease for purposes of accrued \nbenefits is warranted in this case.  Notably, the Veteran was \nhospitalized in January 1959, while on active duty.  Although \nthe medical records from this hospitalization are \nunavailable, service records show a January 1959 diagnosis of \nrenal colic although it is unclear as to whether this is a \nfinal diagnosis.  In early 1960's private medical records, \nthe Veteran gave a history of severe right-sided pain since \n1957; a similar history regarding the onset of chronic \nstomach pain in 1957 was given in an April 1968 private \nmedical record.  The Veteran was also treated for recurrent \nrectal abscesses and fistulas in the perineal area in the \nearly 1960's, and in a 1962 service record, the Veteran \nreported having had such since he had been in the Navy.  A \nhandwritten note which appears to have been prepared around \nJanuary 1963 also shows, in pertinent part, a history of \ntreatment while on active duty for possible colitis.  The \nBoard notes further, that the Veteran also reported in more \nrecent statements that he believed that the onset of his \ndisability was while he was in the Navy when he first began \nto have symptoms that were later diagnosed as Crohn's \ndisease.  \n  \nAt the time of the Veteran's death, evidence of record \nestablished a diagnosis of Crohn's disease.  Service \ntreatment records show that the Veteran was hospitalized at \nthe Naval Hospital in Annapolis for approximately three weeks \nin January 1959.  However, hospital records were not \navailable.  Lay statements from the Veteran show that his \nhospitalization was for pain and other gastrointestinal \nsymptoms.  The Veteran may provide competent evidence in this \nregard.  The Board also finds such statements to be credible \ngiven the contemporaneous objective medical evidence of \nrecord as outlined above.  Post-service treatment reports \nreflect a continuation of such symptoms, and an eventual \ndiagnosis of Crohn's disease.  Based on the foregoing, the \nBoard finds that service connection for Crohn's disease, for \npurposes of accrued benefits, is warranted.  See 38 U.S.C.A. \n§ 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. § 3.102.\n\n\nC.  Conclusion\n\nAt the time of the Veteran's death, he had a diagnosis of \nCrohn's disease, service treatment records indicate \ngastrointestinal symptomatology in service, and with \nresolution of reasonable doubt in the appellant's favor, the \nBoard finds that it is at least as likely as not that the \nVeteran's Crohn's disease had its clinical onset in service.  \nTherefore, the Board concludes that the evidence supports a \nfinding that the Veteran had Crohn's disease etiologically \nrelated to active service.  \n\n\nORDER\n\nService connection for Crohn's disease, for purposes of \naccrued benefits, is granted.\n\n\n\n____________________________________________\nS.

L. Tarr, Associate Counsel\nINTRODUCTION\n\nThe Veteran served on active duty from April 1981 to April 1985, from March 1986 to March 1989, and from November 1990 to April 1991.  He also had active duty for training (ACDUTRA) in the Naval Air Reserve, including a period of ACDUTRA from October 5, 1989 to October 16, 1989.\n\n This appeal to the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) arose from a September 2005 rating decision in which the RO denied service connection for traumatic arthritis, left knee, status postoperative ACL reconstruction.  In September 2005, the Veteran filed a notice of disagreement (NOD).  A statement of the case (SOC) was issued in March 2006, and the Veteran filed a substantive appeal (via a VA Form 9, Appeal to the Board of Veterans' Appeals) in May 2006.\n\nIn September 2006, the Veteran testified during a hearing before a Decision Review Officer (DRO) at the RO; a transcript of that hearing is of record.  \n\nIn July 2010, the Board remanded the claim to the RO, via the Appeals Management Center (AMC) in Washington, DC, for further action, to include additional development of the evidence.  After completing the requested development, the AMC continued to deny the claim (as reflected in a March 2011 supplemental SOC (SSOC)) and returned the matter on appeal to the Board for further consideration.\n\n\nFINDINGS OF FACT\n\n1.  All notification and development actions needed to fairly adjudicate the claim on appeal have been accomplished.\n\n2.  Although the Veteran injured his left knee during service, there was no evidence of a left knee disability for several years after service and the only medical opinion on the question of whether there exists a medical relationship between current left knee disability and the Veteran's military service weighs against the claim.\nCONCLUSION OF LAW\n\nThe criteria for service connection for traumatic arthritis of the left knee, status postoperative ACL reconstruction, are not met.  38 U.S.C.A. §§ 101, 1101, 1110, 1112, 1113, 1131, 1137, 5103, 5103A, 5107 (West 2002 & Supp. 2010); 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.6, 3.102, 3.159, 3.303, 3.307, 3.309 (2010).\n\n\nREASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSION\n\nI.  Duties to Notify and Assist\n\nThe Veterans Claims Assistance Act of 2000 (VCAA), Pub. L. No. 106-475, 114 Stat. 2096 (Nov. 9, 2000) (codified at 38 U.S.C.A. §§ 5100, 5102, 5103, 5103A, 5106, 5107, and 5126 (West 2002 & Supp. 2010)) includes enhanced duties to notify and assist claimants for VA benefits.  VA regulations implementing the VCAA were codified as amended at 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.156(a), 3.159, and 3.326(a) (2010).\n\nNotice requirements under the VCAA essentially require VA to notify a claimant of any evidence that is necessary to substantiate the claim(s), as well as the evidence that VA will attempt to obtain and which evidence he or she is responsible for providing.  See, e.g., Quartuccio v. Principi, 16 Vet. App. 183 (2002) (addressing the duties imposed by 38 U.S.C.A. § 5103(a) and 38 C.F.R. § 3.159(b)).  As delineated in Pelegrini v. Principi, 18 Vet. App. 112 (2004), after a substantially complete application for benefits is received, proper VCAA notice must inform the claimant of any information and evidence not of record (1) that is necessary to substantiate the claim(s); (2) that VA will seek to provide; (3) that the claimant is expected to provide; and (4) must ask the claimant to provide any evidence in her or his possession that pertains to the claim(s), in accordance with 38 C.F.R. § 3.159(b)(1).\n\nThe Board notes that, effective May 30, 2008, 38 C.F.R. § 3.159 has been revised, in part.  See 73 Fed. Reg. 23,353-23,356 (April 30, 2008).  Notably, the final rule removes the third sentence of 38 C.F.R. § 3.159(b)(1), which had stated that VA will request that a claimant provide any pertinent evidence in his or her possession.\n\nVA's notice requirements apply to all five elements of a service connection claim: veteran status, existence of a disability, a connection between a veteran's service and the disability, degree of disability, and effective date of the disability.  Dingess/Hartman v. Nicholson, 19 Vet. App. 473 (2006).  \n\nVCAA-compliant notice must be provided to a claimant before the initial unfavorable decision on a claim for VA benefits by the agency of original jurisdiction (in this case, the RO, to include the AMC).  Id.; Pelegrini, 18 Vet. App. at 112.  See also Disabled American Veterans v. Secretary of Veterans Affairs, 327 F.3d 1339 (Fed. Cir. 2003).  However, the VCAA notice requirements may, nonetheless, be satisfied if any errors in the timing or content of such notice are not prejudicial to the claimant.  Id.\n\nIn this appeal, June 2004 and June 2005 pre-rating letters provided notice to the Veteran explaining what information and evidence was needed to substantiate the claim for service connection for a left knee disability, as well as what information and evidence must be submitted by the appellant, and what information and evidence would be obtained by VA.  The September 2005 RO rating decision reflects the initial adjudication of the claim after issuance of the June 2004 and June 2005 letters.  \n\nPost rating, a March 2006 letter provided the Veteran with general information pertaining to VA's assignment of disability ratings and effective dates, as well as the type of evidence that impacts those determinations, consistent with Dingess/Hartman.  After issuance of the March 2006 letter, and opportunity for the Veteran to respond, the November 2006 SSOC reflects readjudication of the claim.  Hence, the Veteran is not shown to be prejudiced by the timing of this notice.  See Mayfield v. Nicholson, 20 Vet. App. 537, 543 (2006); see also Prickett v. Nicholson, 20 Vet. App. 370, 376 (2006) (the issuance of a fully compliant VCAA notification followed by readjudication of the claim, such as in an SOC or SSOC, is sufficient to cure a timing defect).\n\nThe record also reflects that VA has made reasonable efforts to obtain or to assist in obtaining all relevant records pertinent to the matter on appeal.  Pertinent medical evidence associated with the claims file consists of service, VA, and private treatment records, and the reports of August 2004 and October 2010 VA examinations.  Also of record and considered in connection with the appeal is the transcript of the September 2006 DRO hearing, along with various written statements provided by the Veteran, and by his representative, on his behalf.  The Board also finds that no additional RO action to further develop the record in connection with the claim for service connection for a left knee disability is warranted.\n\nAs regards the October 2010 VA examination conducted pursuant to the Board's July 2010 remand, the Board notes that, while the Board instructed that the examination was to be conducted by a physician (M.D.), this examination was, in fact, performed by a physician assistant.  The Board notes that the Court has recently held that \"only substantial compliance with the terms of the Board's engagement letter would be required, not strict compliance.\"  D'Aries v. Peake, 22 Vet. App. 97, 105 (2008); see also Dyment v. West, 13 Vet. App. 141, 146-47 (1999) (holding that there was no Stegall violation when the examiner made the ultimate determination required by the Board's remand, because such determination \"more than substantially complied with the Board's remand order\").  In this case, the Board's instructions have been substantially complied with as the examiner, a physician's assistant, performed the requested review and offered an opinion with fully stated rationale, and because the opinion was consistent with the competent evidence of record.  \n\nIn summary, the duties imposed by the VCAA have been considered and satisfied.  Through various notices of the RO, the Veteran has been notified and made aware of the evidence needed to substantiate the claim, the avenues through which he might obtain such evidence, and the allocation of responsibilities between himself and VA in obtaining such evidence.  There is no additional notice that should be provided, nor is there any indication that there is additional existing evidence to obtain or development required to create any additional evidence to be considered in connection with the claim.  Consequently, any error in the sequence of events or content of the notice is not shown to prejudice the Veteran or to have any effect on the appeal.  Any such error is deemed harmless and does not preclude appellate consideration of the matter on appeal, at this juncture.  See Mayfield, 20 Vet. App. at 543 (rejecting the argument that the Board lacks authority to consider harmless error).  See also ATD Corp. v. Lydall, Inc., 159 F.3d 534, 549 (Fed. Cir. 1998).\n\nII.  Analysis\n\nService connection may be granted for disability resulting from disease or injury incurred in or aggravated by service.  38 U.S.C.A. §§ 1110, 1131; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303.  Such a determination requires a finding of current disability that is related to an injury or disease in service.  Watson v. Brown, 4 Vet. App. 309 (1993); see also Brammer v. Derwinski, 3 Vet. App. 223, 225 (1992); Rabideau v. Derwinski, 2 Vet. App. 141, 143 (1992).  Service connection may be granted for any disease diagnosed after discharge from service when all the evidence, including that pertinent to service, establishes that the disease was incurred in service.  38 C.F.R. § 3.303(d).\n\nThe Board observes that, with respect to the Veteran's Naval Reserve service, the applicable laws and regulations permit service connection only for disability resulting from disease or injury incurred or aggravated while performing active duty for training (ACDUTRA) or injury incurred or aggravated while performing inactive duty for training (INACDUTRA).  See 38 U.S.C.A. § 101(22), (24); 38 C.F.R. § 3.6.\n\nService connection may be presumed, for certain chronic diseases, such as arthritis,  which develop to a compensable degree (10 percent for arthritis) within a prescribed period after discharge from service (one year for arthritis), although there is no evidence of such disease during the period of service.  This presumption is rebuttable by probative evidence to the contrary.  38 U.S.C.A. §§ 1101, 1112, 1113, 1137; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.307, 3.309.  Also, while the disease need not be diagnosed within the presumptive period, it must be shown, by acceptable lay or medical evidence, that there were characteristic manifestations of the disease to the required degree.  38 C.F.R. § 3.307(c).  \n\nConsidering the pertinent evidence in light of the governing legal authority, the Board finds that the claim for service connection for a left knee disability must be denied. \n\nHere, there is evidence indicating that the Veteran injured his left knee during ACDUTRA.  An October 27, 1989 service treatment record reflects that the Veteran injured his left knee during ACDUTRA 2 weeks prior, while playing basketball.  The Veteran's service records indicate that he served a period of ACDUTRA from October 5, 1989 to October 16, 1989.  Thus, the Veteran's left knee injury appears to have occurred during ACDUTRA.  \n\nService treatment records reflect that his knee gave way and he heard a pop. \nThe Veteran underwent arthroscopic surgery and ACL debridement in December 1989.  He also attended physical therapy through April 1990 for ACL insufficiency/laxity.  In an April 1990 treatment report, the examiner noted that the Veteran's physical therapy goals had been met.\n\nIn an August 1990 report of medical history, the Veteran denied any knee pain or problems.  He noted his history of knee surgery in December 1989.  Examination of the lower extremities was normal.  The examiner noted that there were no limitations following the Veteran's left knee surgery, and that there was no current left knee disability.\n\nSubsequent to the October 1989 left knee injury and December 1989 surgery, the Veteran served an additional tour of active duty from November 1990 to April 1991.  \n\nIn a March 1992 report of medical history, the Veteran noted that he previously had knee surgery and that he experiences some pain and giving way of the left knee.\n\nPost-service, the first documented medical evidence of a left knee disability was in 1997.  A June 1997 private treatment record from Dr. Burwell reveals that the Veteran injured his left knee in May 1997.  The Veteran reported that he slipped while walking to work.  The impression was ACL tear, left knee, with possible medial meniscal tear.  The physician noted that the Veteran previously had a left knee injury while playing basketball years ago, however, there were no residual problems associated with the knee due to the previous basketball injury.\n\nAn October 2002 treatment record from Dr. Schultz reflects that the Veteran slipped while getting out of his truck at work in September 2002.  The physician noted that the Veteran had a left knee arthroscopy for a meniscus repair done during service, but has not had any problems related to the previous injury and surgery.  The impression was a torn ACL, sprained medial collateral ligament (MCL), and probable medial meniscus tear.  Operative reports in the record demonstrate that the Veteran underwent surgery to repair his ACL and MCL in November 2002.\n\nVA treatment records reflect evaluation and treatment for the left knee.  The Veteran's complaints of left knee pain are also documented in the VA medical records.\n\nThe Veteran underwent a VA joints examination in August 2004.  The Veteran reported that he injured his left knee when he stepped in a hole while on active duty and eventually had ACL surgery.  The examiner diagnosed the Veteran with postoperative left knee arthroscopy for medial meniscus tear and ACL debridement, postoperative ACL reconstruction, and moderate degenerative joint disease.  The examiner did not have any of the Veteran's medical records and offered no opinion as to a medical nexus between the veteran's current left knee disability and his in-service injury.  \n\nThe Veteran was afforded a VA examination in October 2010 to obtain a medical etiology opinion as to whether his current left knee disability was related to his left knee injury during service.  The Veteran reported that he injured his knee in-service while playing basketball.  The Veteran also reported a subsequent injury where he was walking to work and stepped in a hole.  He stated that following his in-service left knee surgery, his knee continued to cause pain.  He indicated a subsequent left knee injury during service when he came under a scud missile attack during Desert Storm, but denied treatment for this injury.  Following his final period of active duty, he reported that his left knee continued to cause problems, although he did not seek medical treatment.  The examiner's impression was left arthroscopic ACL debridement in 1989 (no functional limitations) and left knee arthroscopic repair medial meniscus, ACL reconstruction in 2002, with residual traumatic arthritis and moderate functional limitation.  The examiner opined that it was less likely as not that the Veteran's residual traumatic arthritis status post ACL reconstruction and arthroscopic medial meniscus repair are caused by or the result of an injury while on active military duty. \n\nIn a June 2004 statement and during the October 2010 VA examination, the Veteran reported that his knee had never stopped hurting from the time he had left knee surgery during service.  As regards the Veteran's assertions of a continuity of left knee symptomatology since service, the Board points out that a layperson is competent to report on matters observed or within his or her personal knowledge.  See Layno v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 465, 470 (1994); Grottveit v. Brown, 5 Vet. App. 91, 93 (1993).  The Veteran is also competent to testify about observable symptoms or injury residuals.  See 38 C.F.R. § 3.159(a)(2); Barr v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 303 (2007).  Moreover, the Veteran is competent to report a continuity of symptomatology.  See Charles v. Principi, 16 Vet. App. 370 (2002).  \n\nHere, however, the Veteran's assertions that he has had continuous left knee pain since service-made in connection with a claim for monetary benefits-are contradicted by other pertinent, probative evidence, and, thus, are not deemed credible.  On the question of whether the Veteran has experienced left knee pain since service, the Board accepts as most persuasive the Veteran's contemporaneous statement denying any residual knee limitations or disability.  The Board also points out that, as reflected in various post service medical records (in particular, private treatment records from June 1997 and October 2002), the Veteran denied any residual problems associated with his in-service left knee injury and surgery. \n\nThe Board also notes that, notwithstanding the Veteran's assertions, the post-service evidence reflects no documented indication of a left knee disability for over 6 years after active military service, when the Veteran slipped and injured his left knee.  Clearly, such time period is well beyond the presumptive period for establishing service connection for arthritis as a chronic disease.  See 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.307, 3.309.  The Board also points out that the passage of many years between discharge from active service and the objective documentation of a claimed disability is a factor that tends to weigh against a claim for service connection.  See Maxson v. Gober, 230 F.3d 1330, 1333 (Fed. Cir. 2000).  \n\nMoreover, the only medical opinion to address the etiology of the current left knee disability-that of the October 2010 VA examiner-is adverse to the claim.  The Board notes that the examiner rendered this opinion after thoroughly reviewing the claims file and medical records and examining the Veteran.  The examiner also considered the Veteran's assertions regarding his in-service left knee injury and subsequent symptomatology.  The examiner opined that it was least likely that the Veteran's current left knee disability was related to his in-service left knee injury.  The examiner provided a rationale for his opinion; stating that the Veteran was capable of deployment from November 1990 to April 1991 (following his left knee injury and surgery), and there was no evidence of chronicity or continuity of left knee symptoms.  In fact, there is no medical evidence of a post-service left knee disability until intervening left knee injuries in 1997 and 2002.  Significantly, this opinion is consistent with the other medical evidence of record.  In particular, private treatment records evaluating the Veteran's subsequent left knee injuries in 1997 and 2002 reflect that he did not suffer any residual problems from his in-service left knee injury and surgery.\n\nUnder these circumstances, the Board accepts the October 2010 VA examiner's opinion as probative of the medical nexus question.  See, e.g., Hayes v. Brown, 5 Vet. App. 60, 69-70 (1993) (citing Wood v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 190, 192-93 (1992) and Guerrieri v. Brown, 4 Vet. App. 467, 470-471 (1993) (holding that the weight to be attached to medical evidence is within the province of the Board).  Significantly, neither the Veteran nor his representative has presented or identified any contrary medical evidence or opinion, i.e., one that, in fact, supports a finding that there exists a medical nexus between current disability and service.  \n\nFurthermore, to whatever extent assertions of the Veteran and/or his representative are offered in an attempt to establish that there exists a medical nexus between the Veteran's current left knee disability and service, such attempt must fail.  The matter of medical etiology of current left knee disability upon which the claim turns is within the province of trained medical professionals.  See Jones v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 134, 137-38 (1994).  As the Veteran and his representative are not shown to be other than laypersons without the appropriate medical training and expertise, neither is competent to render a probative (persuasive) opinion on such a medical matter.  See, e.g., Bostain v. West, 11 Vet. App. 124, 127 (1998), citing Espiritu v. Derwinski, 2 Vet. App. 492 (1992).  See also Routen v. Brown, 10 Vet. App. 183, 186 (1997) (\"a layperson is generally not capable of opining on matters requiring medical knowledge\").  Hence, the lay assertions in this regard have no probative value.\n\nFor all the foregoing reasons, the Board finds that service connection for a left knee disability must be denied.  In reaching this conclusion, the Board has considered the applicability of the benefit-of-the-doubt doctrine.  However, as the preponderance of the evidence is against the claim, that doctrine is not applicable.  See 38 U.S.C.A. § 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. § 3.102; Gilbert v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 49, 53-56 (1990).\n\n\nORDER\n\nService connection for traumatic arthritis of the left knee, status postoperative ACL reconstruction, is denied.\n\n\n\n____________________________________________\nJACQUELINE E.

Flynn, Associate Counsel\n\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nThe Veteran served in the United States Army from October 1967 to October 1970.  Among other decorations, the Veteran was awarded the Purple Heart for his combat experience in the Republic of Vietnam (Vietnam).  \n\nThis case comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a March 2006 rating decision rendered by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO) in Cleveland, Ohio.  \n\nAlthough, as in the instant case, a veteran's stated claim may only seek service connection for a particular psychiatric disorder, the United States Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims (Court) has held that such a claim \"cannot be a claim limited only to that diagnosis, but must rather be considered a claim for any mental disability that may be reasonably encompassed.\"  Clemons v. Shinseki, 23 Vet. App. 1, 5 (2009).  In essence, a veteran does not file a claim to receive benefits for a particular psychiatric diagnosis that is named on a claims form, but instead makes a general claim for compensation for the difficulties posed by the veteran's mental condition.  \n\nIn the instant case, review of the Veteran's claims file reflects that the Veteran has been diagnosed with various psychiatric disorders in addition to PTSD, to include depression, not otherwise specified and general anxiety disorder.  The RO developed the Veteran's claim for PTSD separately prior to Clemons.  Moreover, the RO developed and denied a separate claim for anxiety disorder in September 2007.  The Veteran has not expressed dissatisfaction with that decision, and thus, that issue is not presently in appellate status.  See Archbold v. Brown, 9 Vet. App. 124, 130 (1996) (stating that pursuant to 38 U.S.C.A. § 7105(a), the filing of a notice of disagreement initiates appellate review in the VA administrative adjudication process, and the request for appellate review is completed by the claimant's filing of a substantive appeal after a statement of the case is issued by VA.)  In light of above, notwithstanding Clemons, the Board will continue to address the Veteran's PTSD claim separately from his other claim for an acquired psychiatric disorder.  \n\nThis case was previously before the Board in November 2010, when it remanded the Veteran's claim in order to solicit additional information from the Veteran regarding a psychological evaluation completed in conjunction with a domestic dispute in May 1993.  As discussed in further detail below, by a November 2010 letter, the Appeals Management Center (AMC) requested the Veteran's assistance to obtain such records, with no response from the Veteran.  The Board finds that its remand instructions have been substantially complied with, and the Board will proceed in adjudicating the Veteran's claim.  See Stegall v. West, 11 Vet. App. 268, 271 (1998) (noting that when the remand orders of the Board are not complied with, the Board errs as a matter of law when it fails to ensure compliance); see also D'Aries v. Peake, 22 Vet. App. 97, 105 (2008); Dyment v. West, 13 Vet. App. 141, 146-47 (1999).  \n\n\nFINDING OF FACT\n\nThe evidence does not show that the Veteran currently has PTSD or that such disability existed at any time during the course of the appeal.  \n\n\nCONCLUSION OF LAW\n\nPTSD was not incurred in or aggravated by the Veteran's active military service.  38 U.S.C.A. §§ 1110, 1131, 5103, 5103A, 5107 (West 2002 & Supp. 2011); 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.159, 3.102, 3.303, 3.310 (2011).\n\n\nREASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION\n\nThe Veterans Claims Assistance Act of 2000 (VCAA)\n\nThe Board has given consideration to the VCAA, which includes an enhanced duty on the part of VA to notify a veteran of the information and evidence necessary to substantiate claims for VA benefits.  See 38 U.S.C.A. §§ 5103, 5103A (West 2002 & Supp. 2011); 38 C.F.R. § 3.159 (2011).  The VCAA also redefines the obligations of VA with respect to its statutory duty to assist veterans in the development of their claims.  See 38 U.S.C.A. §§ 5103, 5103A (West 2002 & Supp. 2011).\n\nUpon receipt of a complete or substantially complete application for benefits, VA is required to notify the claimant and her representative, if any, of any information, and any medical or lay evidence, that is necessary to substantiate the claim.  See 38 U.S.C.A. § 5103(a) (West 2002); 38 C.F.R. § 3.159(b) (2011); Quartuccio v. Principi, 16 Vet. App. 183 (2002).  Proper notice from VA must inform the claimant of any information and evidence not of record (1) that is necessary to substantiate the claim; (2) that VA will seek to provide; and (3) that the claimant is expected to provide.  This notice must be provided prior to an initial unfavorable decision on a claim by the agency of original jurisdiction.  See Mayfield v. Nicholson, 444 F.3d 1328 (Fed. Cir. 2006); Pelegrini v. Principi, 18 Vet. App. 112 (2004).\n\nIn addition, the notice requirements of the VCAA apply to all five elements of a service-connection claim, including: (1) veteran status; (2) existence of a disability; (3) a connection between the veteran's service and the disability; (4) degree of disability; and (5) effective date of the disability.  See Dingess v. Nicholson, 19 Vet. App. 473 (2006).  Further, this notice must include information that a disability rating and an effective date for the award of benefits will be assigned if service connection is awarded.  See id. at 486.  Determinations concerning prejudicial error and harmless error should be made on a case-by-case basis.  See Shinseki v. Sanders, 129 S.Ct. 1696 (2009).  \n\nIn the instant case, correspondence dated August 2005 notified the Veteran of information and evidence necessary to substantiate the claim; information and evidence that VA would seek to provide; and information and evidence that the Veteran was expected to provide.  The Veteran filed his claim prior to the Court's 2006 decision in Dingess, and as such, he was not provided with full Dingess notice at the time of the August 2005 VCAA letter.  Instead, in March 2006, pursuant to the Court's holding in Dingess, the Veteran was provided with notice regarding the degree of disability and effective date.  Additionally, since the time of the March 2006 Dingess notice, the Veteran has been provided with several readjudications of his claim, and the Board finds that there has been no prejudice to the Veteran requiring additional notice.  The Board finds that the notice provisions of the VCAA have been fulfilled, and that no further notice is necessary.\n\nWith respect to the duty to assist, VA has done everything reasonably possible to assist the Veteran with respect to his claim for benefits in accordance with 38 U.S.C.A. § 5103A (West 2002) and 38 C.F.R. § 3.159(c) (2011).  Service treatment records have been associated with the claims file.  All identified and available post-service treatment records have been secured, which include VA treatment records.  The Veteran's representative provided court records from a domestic relations matter that suggested that the Veteran may have undergone a psychiatric evaluation around May 2003.  Acknowledging the potential probative value of such records, the Board's November 2010 Remand instructed the AMC to contact the Veteran to provide additional information in order to obtain these records.  Accordingly, in November 2010, the AMC sent a letter requested the Veteran's assistance to obtain these records.  To date, the Veteran has not responded to this request for additional information.\n\nAdditionally, the Veteran was provided with a VA examination in February 2006.  The examination report indicates that the examiner reviewed the Veteran's claim file, past medical history, recorded his current complaints, conducted an appropriate evaluation, and rendered an appropriate diagnosis and opinion consistent with the remainder of the evidence of record.  The Board, therefore, concludes that this examination report is adequate for the purposes of rendering a decision in the instant appeal.  See 38 C.F.R. § 4.2 (2011); see also Barr v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 303, 312 (2007).  Neither the Veteran nor his representative has contended otherwise.  \n\nThe Veteran requested a hearing on his VA Form 9, substantive appeal.  Accordingly, the Veteran was scheduled to appear for a hearing with a Veterans Law Judge in April 2008.  The Veteran failed to report for this hearing.  The Veteran provided no explanation for his failure to report, and he has not since requested a rescheduling of the hearing.  The Veteran's hearing request, therefore, is deemed withdrawn.  See 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.702(d); 20.704(d) (2011).  \n\n\nThus, the duties to notify and assist have been met, and the Board will proceed to a decision.\n\nService Connection\n\nService connection may be granted for disability or injury incurred in or aggravated by active military service.  38 U.S.C.A. §§ 1110, 1131 (West 2002); 38 C.F.R.        § 3.303(a) (2011).  In the absence of medical evidence or persuasive probative lay evidence showing the Veteran has the condition alleged, service connection is not warranted.  The case law is well-settled on this point.  In order for a claimant to be granted service connection for a claimed disability, there must be evidence of a current disability.  See Wamhoff v. Brown, 8 Vet. App. 517, 521 (1996); Brammer v. Derwinski, 3 Vet. App. 223, 225 (1992) (noting that service connection is limited to cases in which the service incident has resulted in a disability, and in the absence of proof of a present disability, there can be no valid claim); see also Rabideau v. Derwinski, 2 Vet. App. 141, 144 (1992) (stating that service connection claim must be accompanied by evidence establishing the claimant currently has the claimed disability).\n\nService connection may also be granted for any disease initially diagnosed after service, when the evidence establishes that the disease was incurred in service.  See 38 U.S.C.A. § 1113(b) (West 2002); 38 C.F.R. § 3.303(d) (2011); Cosman v. Principi, 3 Vet. App. 503, 505 (1992).  The disease entity for which service connection is sought must be chronic rather than acute and transitory in nature.  For the showing of chronic disease in service, a combination of manifestations must exist sufficient to identify the disease entity and sufficient observation to establish chronicity at the time, as distinguished from merely isolated findings or a diagnosis including the word \"chronic.\"  Continuity of symptomatology is required when the condition noted during service is not shown to be chronic or where the diagnosis of chronicity may be legitimately questioned.  38 C.F.R. § 3.303(b) (2011).\n\nService connection for PTSD requires: (1) medical evidence diagnosing PTSD; (2) credible supporting evidence that the claimed in-service stressor actually occurred; and (3) medical evidence of a link between the Veteran's current symptomatology and the claimed in-service stressor.  See 38 C.F.R. § 3.304(f) (2011); see also Cohen v. Brown, 10 Vet. App. 128 (1997).  The regulations pertaining to PTSD were recently amended, and 38 C.F.R. §3.304(f)(3) no longer requires the verification of an in-service stressor if the Veteran was in a location involving \"fear of hostile military or terrorist activity.\"  Such a location can be evidenced by awards such as the Iraq Campaign Medal or the Vietnam Service Medal.  Lay testimony alone can be used to establish the occurrence of an in-service stressor in these situations.  The new regulatory provision requires that: (1) A VA psychiatrist or psychologist, or contract equivalent, must confirm that the claimed stressor is adequate to support a diagnosis of PTSD; (2) the claimed stressor is consistent with the places, types, and circumstances of the Veteran's service; and (3) the Veteran's symptoms are related to the claimed stressor.  Id.  The liberalizing criteria contained in the new § 3.304(f)(3) will be applied to PTSD service connection claims that are pending as of the effective date of the regulation (July 13, 2010) and to claims filed on or after this effective date. \n\nAfter the evidence has been assembled, it is the Board's responsibility to evaluate the entire record.  See 38 U.S.C.A. § 7104(a) (West 2002).  When there is an approximate balance of evidence regarding the merits of an issue material to the determination of the matter, the Board resolves the benefit of the doubt for each such issue in favor of the veteran.  See 38 U.S.C.A. § 5107 (West 2002); 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 4.3 (2011).\n\nThe Court has stated that a veteran need only demonstrate that there is an \"approximate balance of positive and negative evidence\" in order to prevail on a claim for benefits.  Gilbert v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 49, 53 (1990).  To deny a claim on its merits, the preponderance of the evidence must be against the claim.  See Alemany v. Brown, 9 Vet. App. 518, 519 (1996) (citing Gilbert, 1 Vet. App. at 54).\n\nIn the instant case, as noted above, service connection for PTSD requires the presence of a currently-diagnosed disability.  The Board notes that the record contains no diagnosis of PTSD at anytime during the course of the appeal.  Rather, the report of the Veteran's February 2006 VA examination stated that Veteran did not meet the criteria for PTSD.  The Veteran denied recurrent nightmares related to his experience in Vietnam; he further stated that he occasionally dreamed of Vietnam but stated that such dreams did not bother him.  The Veteran initially denied recurrent and intrusive memories of Vietnam, but then acknowledged that he had \"some bad memories sometime[s].\"  The Veteran denied efforts to avoid trauma-associated conversations.  The Veteran denied feelings of detachment and markedly diminished interest and participation in significant activities.  The Veteran denied hypervigilance, exaggerated startle response, irritability, anger, and depression.  The examiner diagnosed the Veteran with early full remission from alcohol dependence.  The examiner acknowledged that the Veteran had traumatic experiences in Vietnam and that he had some PTSD signs, but he found that the Veteran did not generally meet the criteria for PTSD.\n\nSimilarly, the Board has reviewed all of the Veteran's VA treatment records, and it has found no indication that the Veteran has ever been diagnosed with PTSD.  As the record contains no competent diagnosis of PTSD in the Veteran, the Board's consideration of entitlement to service connection for PTSD fails on the this basis alone.  \n\nThe evidence of record is unclear even as to whether the Veteran himself believes that he has PTSD.  The Veteran, in his June 2004 claim, stated \"I do have PTSD.\" Affording the Veteran with every possible consideration and acknowledging that the Veteran is competent to testify as to symptomatology such as the feelings that he experiences, the Veteran was provided with a VA medical examination as a result of the assertion in his June 2004 claim.  See Barr v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 303 (2007); see also Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F. 3d 1372 (Fed. Cir. 2007).  At his February 2006 examination, however, the Veteran stated that he \"never claimed for PTSD\" and did \"not know the meaning of PTSD.\"  As noted above, the objective evidence fails to show that the Veteran has had PTSD at any time during the appeal.  Moreover, the Veteran, as a lay person, is not competent to opine that any psychological symptomatology is attributable to a particular underlying disability.  \n\nIn the absence of any probative evidence of the existence of PTSD, service connection may not be granted.  See 38 C.F.R. § 3.304(f) (2011); see also Cohen v. Brown, 10 Vet. App. 128 (1997); Rabideau v. Derwinski, 2 Vet. App. 141, 144 (1992) (noting that service connection cannot be granted if the claimed disability does not exist).  Accordingly, there is no evidence of a current disability, and the Veteran's claim for service connection for PTSD fails on this basis alone.  In reaching this conclusion, the Board considered the doctrine of reasonable doubt.  See 38 U.S.C.A. § 5107(b) (West 2002).  However, as the preponderance of the evidence is against the claim, the doctrine is not for application.  See Ortiz v. Principi, 274 F. 3d 1361 (Fed. Cir. 2001); Gilbert v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 49 (1990).\n\n\nORDER\n\nService connection for PTSD is denied.\n\n\n\n____________________________________________\nDAVID L.

Cameron, Attorney\n\n\nATTORNEY FOR THE BOARD\n\nE. Joyner, Counsel\n\n\n\n\n\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nThe Veteran served on active duty from January 1985 to January 1988 and from May 1989 to May 1993.  He also had additional service in the Army National Guard.  \n\nThis matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a June 2004 rating decision of the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO) in Montgomery, Alabama.  \n\nWhen the case was previously before the Board in August 2009, June 2010, and September 2011 it was remanded for additional development.  \n\n\nFINDING OF FACT\n\nIt is at least as likely as not that the Veteran's schizophrenia had its onset within one year of the Veteran's May 1993 discharge from service.\n\n\nCONCLUSION OF LAW\n\nIn giving the Veteran the benefit of the doubt, schizophrenia was incurred in active service.  38 U.S.C.A. §§ 1101, 1110, 1112, 5103, 5103A, 5107 (West 2014); 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.159, 3.303, 3.307, 3.309 (2014).\n\n\nREASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION\n\nDuties to Notify and Assist\n\nIn this decision, the Board grants entitlement to service connection for schizophrenia, which constitutes a complete grant of the Veteran's claim.  Therefore, no discussion of VA's duty to notify or assist is necessary.  \n\nLegal Analysis\n\nService connection may be established for disability resulting from personal injury suffered or disease contracted in line of duty in the active military, naval, or air service.  38 U.S.C.A. §§ 1110, 1131.  That an injury or disease occurred in service is not enough; there must be chronic disability resulting from that injury or disease.  If there is no showing of a resulting chronic condition during service, then a showing of continuity of symptomatology after service is required to support a finding of chronicity.  38 C.F.R. § 3.303(b).  Service connection may also be granted for any injury or disease diagnosed after discharge, when all the evidence, including that pertinent to service, establishes that the disease or injury was incurred in service.  38 C.F.R. § 3.303(d).  Other specifically enumerated disorders, including psychoses, will be presumed to have been incurred in service if manifested to a compensable degree within the first year following separation from active duty.  38 U.S.C.A. §§ 1101, 1112, 1113; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.307, 3.309.\n\nIn Walker v. Shinseki, 708 F.3d 1331 (Fed. Cir. 2013), the Federal Circuit held that the theory of continuity of symptomatology can be used only in cases involving those conditions explicitly recognized as chronic in 38 C.F.R. § 3.309(a).  Walker v. Shinseki, 708 F.3d 1331 (Fed. Cir. 2013).  As discussed more thoroughly below, the Veteran is diagnosed with schizophrenia, a psychosis, which is recognized as a chronic disability in 38 C.F.R. § 3.309(a).\n\nIn relevant part, 38 U.S.C.A. § 1154(a) requires that VA give 'due consideration' to 'all pertinent medical and lay evidence' in evaluating a claim for disability benefits. In order to establish direct service connection for a disorder, there must be (1) competent evidence of the current existence of the disability for which service connection is being claimed; (2) competent evidence of a disease contracted, an injury suffered, or an event witnessed or experienced in active service; and (3) competent evidence of a nexus or connection between the disease, injury, or event in service and the current disability.  Davidson v. Shinseki, 581 F.3d 1313 (Fed. Cir. Sept. 14, 2009); cf. Gutierrez  v. Principi, 19 Vet. App. 1, 5 (2004) (citing Hickson v. West, 12 Vet. App. 247, 253 (1999)).  In many cases, medical evidence is required to meet the requirement that the evidence be \"competent.\"  However, when a condition may be diagnosed by its unique and readily identifiable features, the presence of the disorder is not a determination \"medical in nature\" and is capable of lay observation.  Barr v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 303, 309 (2007). \n\nIn rendering a decision on appeal, the Board must analyze the credibility and probative value of the evidence, account for the evidence which it finds to be persuasive or unpersuasive, and provide the reasons for its rejection of any material evidence favorable to the claimant.  See Gabrielson v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 36, 39-40 (1994); Gilbert v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 49, 57 (1990).  When there is an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence regarding any issue material to the determination of a matter, the benefit of the doubt shall be given to the claimant.  38 U.S.C.A. § 5107(b).  When a reasonable doubt arises regarding service origin, such doubt will be resolved in the favor of the claimant.  Reasonable doubt is doubt which exists because of an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence which does not satisfactorily prove or disprove the claim.  38 C.F.R. § 3.102.  The question is whether the evidence supports the claim or is in relative equipoise, with the claimant prevailing in either event, or whether a fair preponderance of the evidence is against the claim, in which event the claim must be denied.  See Gilbert, 1 Vet. App. at 54. \n\nThe Veteran contends that he is entitled to service connection for schizophrenia because it had its onset within one year of his separation from his second period of active duty in May 1993.  \n\nThe medical evidence of record confirms that the Veteran has a current diagnosis of schizophrenia.  The service treatment records reflect that the Veteran was not diagnosed with schizophrenia in service.  However, they do reflect that in October 1989, February 1990 and April 1990 the Veteran was in counseling and received Antabuse for alcohol abuse.  \n\nThe record shows that the first diagnosis of schizophrenia was in September 1995, according to a Social Security Administration (SSA) record.  The SSA disability records also reflect that the Veteran began having mental problems in 1994 and that although he had been on medications, he had not had any for a year.  A May 2003 VA treatment record reflects that the Veteran's mother had given a history of the Veteran having had mental problems since 1994, when he was hearing voices and pacing at night.  \n\nAs noted in the September 2011 Board remand, the Veteran has maintained that he was admitted to a VA hospital in Tuskegee, Alabama, in May 1995 for about a month, for psychiatric treatment.  The remand notes that the Veteran's VA hospitalization and other records dated prior to August 2001 are not associated with the claims file.  As such, the Board remanded the claim in September 2011, in part, in order to obtain any VA treatment records dating from May 1993 to August 2001.  Although there are four requests for VA treatment records in the claims file (the first request is for records dated from May 1993 to August 2001, but the next three requests are only for records dating from May 1993 to May 1995), a letter from Central Alabama Veterans Health Care System indicates that the system of records does not contain a record retrievable from May 1, 1993 to May 1, 1995 in the system or in the federal record center.  However, the claims file does contain an August 2001 VA social work initial assessment note, which indicates that the Veteran was admitted on August 8, 2001 to Tuskegee VA Medical Center, and importantly, that he had previously been admitted in 1994.  \n\nThe claims file also contains two VA examination reports.  A November 2009 VA examination report reflects that the Veteran was hospitalized for his psychiatric problems on two occasions, the last of which was in 2001.  The examiner opined that the records suggest that the Veteran did not experience thought symptoms until he was 28 years old (1994), and he did not seek treatment for them until he was 29 years old (1995).  The examiner stated that review of the Veteran's service discharge records suggests that he did not endorse thought symptoms upon discharge.  The examiner further noted that the average age of onset for schizophrenia and other longitudinal thought disorders among males is 18 to 19 years old.  In light of the above-noted considerations, the examiner opined that schizophrenia is less likely as not caused by or a result of military service.  \n\nPursuant to the directives in the June 2010 Board remand, which acknowledged that the November 2009 VA examiner had not addressed whether a psychosis became manifest to a compensable degree within one year of the Veteran's separation from active service in May 1993 despite indicating that the Veteran did not experience thought symptoms until 1994 (which the Board noted might be within one year of discharge from service), the Veteran underwent another VA examination in August 2010.  The August 2010 VA examination report, authored by the same (November 2009) VA examiner, indicates that the Veteran's reports and demeanor remained consistent with the previous diagnosis and severity estimate.  The examiner noted that he specifically asked the Veteran if his thought symptoms became evident prior to May 1994, which is one year after discharge.  The examiner noted that the Veteran denied thought symptoms prior to that time and he responded with certainty in this regard, impressing the examiner as being honest and forthcoming.  In light of this, the examiner indicated that he must stand by his previous opinion that the Veteran's current thought symptoms (diagnosed as schizophrenia) are less likely than not caused by or a result of military service.\n\nThe Board notes that the weight of a medical opinion is diminished where that opinion is ambivalent, based on an inaccurate factual premise, based on an examination of limited scope, or where the basis for the opinion is not stated.  See Reonal v. Brown, 5 Vet. App. 548 (1993); Sklar v. Brown, 5 Vet. App. 140 (1993); Guerrieri v. Brown, 4 Vet. App. 467 (1993).  Initially, the Board notes that neither VA medical opinion acknowledges the Veteran's alcohol abuse and counseling for such during service.  Moreover, while the November 2009 opinion is against the claim, the rationale (that thought disorders typically manifest at age 18 or 19) does not actually support the conclusion reached.  With respect to the August 2010 opinion, the Board finds that the examiner's opinion it is not based entirely on the evidence of record.  As noted above, the VA treatment records and SSA records note that the Veteran's symptoms began in 1994 and that the was in fact hospitalized in 1994 in Tuskegee VA Medical Center.  Additionally, the Board notes that the Veteran's active duty for training dates during his National Guard service in 1993, 1994, 2000, and 2001 have not been obtained, nor have his service records from his national guard service.  Because this claim has been remanded three times and has been pending for approximately 10 years, the Board finds that the evidence of record, as it currently stands, it at least in equipoise with regard to whether the Veteran's schizophrenia had its onset within one year of his discharge from service in May 1993.  \n\nThe Board finds that the service treatment records showing alcohol abuse in service, which could certainly be the first signs of the Veteran trying to cope with his schizophrenia/thought symptoms, as well as Veteran's and his mother's lay statements, are significant.  The Veteran and his mother are competent, even as laypersons, to attest to factual matters of which they have firsthand knowledge, such as experiencing and witnessing bizarre behavior consistent with a psychosis within one year of service.  See Washington v. Nicholson, 19 Vet. App. 362, 368 (2005); see also Buchanan v. Nicholson, 451 F.3d 1331, 1335 (Fed. Cir. 2006)(holding that lay evidence is one type of evidence that must be considered, and that competent lay evidence can be sufficient in and of itself).  And, although the Veteran stated to the August 2010 VA examiner that his thought symptoms did not begin prior to May 1994, in giving the Veteran the benefit of the doubt as to whether the thought symptoms began prior to May 1994, the Board finds that the service treatment records showing treatment for alcohol abuse in service weigh heavily in the Veteran's favor regarding the likely onset of his symptoms.  In sum, rather than remand the matter for additional development, the Board finds that there are sufficient facts to favorably apply the benefit-of-the-doubt doctrine.  As such, the claim of entitlement to service connection for schizophrenia is granted.  \n\n\nORDER\n\nEntitlement to service connection for schizophrenia is granted.\n\n\n\n____________________________________________\nKATHLEEN K.

Kim, Associate Counsel \n\n\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nThe Veteran served on active duty from August 1958 to August 1962.  \n\nThis matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a December 2013 rating decision decided by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO) in Huntington, West Virginia.   \n\nIn October 2015, the Veteran testified at a videoconference hearing before the undersigned Veterans Law Judge (VLJ).  A hearing transcript has been associated with the record. \n\nThis matter was previously remanded in December 2015 for further development and now returns to the Board for final appellate review. \n\nThis appeal was processed using the Virtual VA and Virtual Benefits Management System (VBMS) paperless claims processing systems.\n\nThis appeal has been advanced on the Board's docket pursuant to 38 C.F.R. § 20.900(c) (2015).  38 U.S.C.A. § 7107(a)(2) (West 2014).\n\n\nFINDING OF FACT\n\nA left knee disability is not shown to be causally or etiologically related to any disease, injury, or incident during service, and arthritis did not manifest within one year of service discharge.  \n\n\n\n\n\n\nCONCLUSION OF LAW\n\nThe criteria for service connection for a left knee disability have not been met.  §§ 1101, 1112, 1131, 1137, 5107 (West 2014); 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303, 3.307, 3.309 (2015).  \n\n\nREASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION\n\nThe Veterans Claims Assistance Act of 2000 (VCAA) and implementing regulations impose obligations on VA to provide claimants with notice and assistance.  38 U.S.C.A. §§ 5102, 5103, 5103A, 5107 (West 2014); 38 C.F.R. \n§§ 3.102, 3.156(a), 3.159, 3.326(a) (2015).  Proper VCAA notice must inform the claimant of any information and evidence not of record (1) that is necessary to substantiate the claim; (2) that VA will seek to provide; and (3) that the claimant is expected to provide.  38 U.S.C.A. § 5103(a); 38 C.F.R. § 3.159(b)(1).\n\nIn Dingess/Hartman v. Nicholson, 19 Vet. App. 473 (2006), the United States Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims (Court) held that the VCAA notice requirements of 38 U.S.C.A. § 5103(a)  and 38 C.F.R. § 3.159(b)  apply to all five elements of a service connection claim.  Those five elements include: 1) Veteran status; 2) existence of a disability; 3) a connection between the Veteran's service and the disability; 4) degree of disability; and 5) effective date of the disability. \n\nIn Pelegrini v. Principi, 18 Vet. App. 112 (2004), the Court held that VCAA notice, as required by 38 U.S.C.A. § 5103(a), must be provided to a claimant before the initial unfavorable AOJ decision on the claim for VA benefits.\n\nRelevant to the claim adjudicated herein, the Board finds that VA has satisfied its duty to notify under the VCAA.  In this regard, while an October 2013 letter, sent prior to the December 2013 rating decision, and an October 2015 letter, sent after the December 2013 rating decision, only advised the Veteran that he should send any treatment records or other evidence relating to his disability during service, the Board finds that, despite such deficient notice, no prejudice results to the Veteran in proceeding with a decision on his claim at this time. \n\nIn the instant case, neither the Veteran nor his representative has identified any deficiency in notice which would compromise a fair adjudication of the claim. Nevertheless, the Board has considered whether the defective notice provided to the Veteran resulted in prejudicial error. \n\nIn this regard, the Board observes that, although the Supreme Court reversed the presumptive prejudice framework set forth in Sanders, it did not find fault with the analysis for determining whether a VCAA notice error affected the essential fairness of the adjudication.   See Sanders v. Nicholson, 487 F.3d 881 (2007), rev'd on other grounds, Shinseki v. Sanders, 129 S.Ct. 1696 (2009).  Accordingly, where there is a defect in the content of VCAA notice, it may be established that such error did not affect the essential fairness of the adjudication by showing that the essential purpose of the notice was not frustrated.  See Sanders at 889.  Such a showing may be made by demonstrating, for example, (1) that the claimant had actual knowledge of what was necessary to substantiate the claim and that the claim was otherwise properly developed, (2) that a reasonable person could be expected to understand from the notice what was needed to substantiate the claim, or (3) that the benefit could not be awarded as a matter of law.  Id.  \n\nIn this case, the evidence of record reflects that a reasonable person could have been expected to understand what was needed to support the Veteran's service connection claim for a left knee disability based on notice that was provided to him during the course of his appeal.  Specifically, the December 2013 decision, February 2014 statement of the case, and February 2016 supplemental statement of the case informed the Veteran of the basis of the original denial, the elements of service connection, and VA's and his respective responsibilities in obtaining evidence in support of his claim. \n\nIn this regard, the December 2013 rating decision informed the Veteran the evidence did not show that his condition was not a result of his military service. Furthermore, the February 2014 statement of the case informed him of the provisions of sections 3.159 (VA assistance in developing claims); 3.303 (principles relating to service connection); 3.304 (direct service connection); and 3.306 (aggravation of preservice disability).  Moreover, such specifically informed him of elements of service connection and advised him that the evidence received in connection with his current claim does not demonstrate that his claimed disability was incurred in or otherwise related to his service.  The February 2016 supplemental statement of the case again informed him of the basis for the determination that service connection could not be established because evidence, to include a February 2016 Disability Benefits Questionnaire (DBQ) report, did not establish that the claimed left knee disability was related to service.  Further, there was no evidence of arthritis within a year post-service.   \n\nMoreover, the Board finds that the Veteran had actual knowledge of what was necessary to establish a service connection claim for a left knee disability.  In this regard, the testimony provided through questioning at the October 2015 Board videoconference hearing indicates that the Veteran understood that the evidence need to show that his left knee disability was incurred in or caused by his military service.  In this regard, the Veteran testified that he injured his left knee in boot camp, but that he did not seek treatment during service because being placed in \"sick bay\" meant that he would have been \"considered not a good person\" and that \"[t]here was something wrong with you.\"  See October 2015 hearing transcript at 5.  Furthermore, the Veteran has submitted lay statements from his brothers, reporting that they have observed the Veteran's reported left knee injury during his service.  See January 2014 statements.  The Veteran also submitted a November 2013 statement, recounting the claimed in-service left knee injury.  Therefore, based on the Veteran's own statements, as well as lay statements submitted on behalf of the Veteran, the Board finds that the Veteran has demonstrated actual knowledge of the evidence and information necessary to substantiate his service connection claim for a left knee disability. \n\nFor the foregoing reasons, the Board finds that VA's failure to provide the Veteran with adequate VCAA notice with respect to the elements of service connection, and VA's and his respective responsibilities in obtaining evidence in support of his claim did not affect the essential fairness of the adjudication of his claim and, therefore, such error is harmless. \n\nThe Board further observes that the Veteran was not provided notice of the evidence and information necessary to establish a disability rating and an effective date in accordance with Dingess/Hartman, supra.  However, the Board finds no prejudice in proceeding with a decision regarding the Veteran's service connection claim.  In this regard, as the Board concludes herein that the preponderance of the evidence is against the Veteran's claim, any questions as to the appropriate disability rating or effective date to be assigned are rendered moot.  Therefore, the Board finds no prejudice to the Veteran in proceeding with the issuance of a final decision.  See Bernard v. Brown, 4 Vet. App. 384, 394 (1993) (where the Board addresses a question that has not been addressed by the agency of original jurisdiction, the Board must consider whether the Veteran has been prejudiced thereby). \n\nAccordingly, the Board finds that VA has satisfied its duty to notify under the VCAA in accordance with 38 U.S.C.A. § 5103(a)  and 38 C.F.R. § 3.159(b)(1) . \n\nNext, VA has a duty to assist the Veteran in the development of the claim.  This duty includes assisting him in the procurement of service treatment records and pertinent treatment records and providing an examination when necessary.  38 U.S.C.A.  § 5103A; 38 C.F.R. § 3.159. \n\nRelevant to the duty to assist, the Veteran's service treatment records and post-service VA treatment records have been obtained and considered.  At the October 2015 videoconference hearing, the Veteran testified that he received all of his post-service medical treatment at VA.  The AOJ issued a formal finding of unavailability of service treatment records in October 2013 and notified the Veteran of such in an October 2013 letter.  Neither the Veteran nor his representative has identified any additional, outstanding records that have not been requested or obtained.   Therefore, the Board finds that VA has satisfied its duty to assist in this regard.  \n\nThe Veteran was afforded a DBQ examination in February 2016.  The Board finds that the February 2016 DBQ examination is adequate to decide the issue on appeal as it is predicated on an interview with the Veteran, a review of the record, to include his in-service and post-service medical records, lay statements, and an appropriate examination.  The Board finds that the conclusions reached by the VA examiner considered all of the pertinent evidence of record and provided a complete rationale, relying on and citing to the records reviewed.  Moreover, the examiner offered clear conclusions with supporting data as well as reasoned medical explanations connecting the two.  See Nieves-Rodriguez v. Peake, 22 Vet. App. 295 (2008); Stefl v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 120, 124 (2007) (\"[A] medical opinion . . . must support its conclusion with an analysis that the Board can consider and weigh against contrary opinions\").  Accordingly, the Board finds that VA's duty to assist with respect to obtaining a VA examination and opinion regarding the issue decided herein has been met. \n\nIn December 2015, the Board remanded the case for additional development.  The Board directed the AOJ to obtain updated treatment record, afford the Veteran a VA examination as to the claimed left knee disability, and readjudicated the Veteran's claim in a supplemental statement of the case.  As per the December 2015 remand directive, updated VA treatment records through December 2015 were obtained, the Veteran was afforded a DBQ examination in February 2016, and the Veteran's claim was readjudicated in a February 2016 supplemental statement of case (SSOC).  Based on the foregoing, the Board finds that the AOJ has substantially complied with the December 2015 remand directives such that no further action is necessary in this regard.  See D'Aries, supra.\n\nAdditionally, in October 2015, the Veteran was provided an opportunity to set forth his contentions during the hearing before the undersigned Veterans Law Judge.  In Bryant v. Shinseki, the Court held that 38 C.F.R. § 3.103(c)(2) requires that the RO Decision Review Officer or Veterans Law Judge who chairs a hearing to fulfill two duties: (1) the duty to fully explain the issues and (2) the duty to suggest the submission of evidence that may have been overlooked.  Bryant v. Shinseki, 23 Vet. App. 488 (2010). \n\t\nHere, during the October 2015 hearing, the undersigned Veterans Law Judge enumerated the issue on appeal.  Also, information was solicited regarding the Veteran's in-service and post-service left knee symptoms.  His representative provided argument that the Veteran's left knee disability was a result of his military service, to specifically include the in-service left knee injury.  Moreover, the undersigned advised the Veteran of the type of evidence needed to establish the service connection claim.  Therefore, not only was the issue \"explained . . . in terms of the scope of the claim for benefits,\" but \"the outstanding issues material to substantiating the claim,\" were also fully explained.  Id. at 497.  Moreover, the hearing discussion did not reveal any additional outstanding evidence necessary for the adjudication of such issue.  Under these circumstances, nothing gives rise to the possibility that evidence had been overlooked with regard to the Veteran's claim decided herein.  As such, the Board finds that, consistent with Bryant, the undersigned Veterans Law Judge complied with the duties set forth in 38 C.F.R. 3.103(c)(2)  and that the Board may proceed to adjudicate the claim based on the current record.\n\nThus, the Board finds that VA has fully satisfied the duty to assist.  In the circumstances of this case, additional efforts to assist or notify the Veteran in accordance with the VCAA would serve no useful purpose.  See Soyini v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 540, 546 (1991) (strict adherence to requirements of the law does not dictate an unquestioning, blind adherence in the face of overwhelming evidence in support of the result in a particular case; such adherence would result in unnecessarily imposing additional burdens on VA with no benefit flowing to the Veteran); Sabonis v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 426, 430 (1994) (remands which would only result in unnecessarily imposing additional burdens on VA with no benefit flowing to the Veteran are to be avoided).  VA has satisfied its duty to inform and assist the Veteran at every stage in this case; at least insofar as any errors committed were not harmful to the essential fairness of the proceeding.  Therefore, the Veteran will not be prejudiced as a result of the Board proceeding to the merits of his claims.  \n\n\n\nII.  Analysis \n\nService connection may be granted for a disability resulting from disease or injury incurred in or aggravated by service.  38 U.S.C.A. §§ 1131; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303(a).  Service connection may also be granted for any disease diagnosed after discharge, when all of the evidence, including that pertinent to service, establishes that the disease was incurred in service. 38 C.F.R. § 3.303(d).\n\nDirect service connection may not be granted without evidence of a current disability; in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and a nexus between the claimed in-service disease or injury and the present disease or injury. Id.; see also Caluza v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 498, 506 (1995), aff'd, 78 F.3d 604 (Fed. Cir. 1996). \n\nAdditionally, for Veterans who have served 90 days or more of active service during a war period or after December 31, 1946, certain chronic disabilities, such as arthritis, are presumed to have been incurred in service if manifest to a compensable degree within one year of discharge from service.  38 U.S.C.A. §§ 1101, 1112, 1137; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.307, 3.309.  \n\nAlternatively, when a disease at 38 C.F.R. § 3.309(a) is not shown to be chronic during service or the one year presumptive period, service connection may also be established by showing continuity of symptomatology after service.  See 38 C.F.R.\n§ 3.303(b).  However, the use of continuity of symptoms to establish service connection is limited only to those diseases listed at 38 C.F.R. § 3.309(a) and does not apply to other disabilities which might be considered chronic from a medical standpoint.  See Walker v. Shinseki, 708 F.3d 1331 (Fed. Cir. 2013).  \n\nPertinent to a claim for service connection, such a determination requires a finding of current disability that is related to an injury or disease in service.  See Brammer v. Derwinski, 3 Vet. App. 223 (1992).  The requirement of a current disability is satisfied when the Veteran has a disability at the time he files his service connection claim or during the pendency of that claim, even if the disability resolves prior to adjudication of the claim.  McClain v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 319, 321 (2007). However, when the record contains a recent diagnosis of disability prior to the Veteran's filing of a claim for benefits based on that disability, the report of the diagnosis is relevant evidence that the Board must address in determining whether a current disability existed at the time the claim was filed or during its pendency. Romanowsky v. Shinseki, 26 Vet. App. 289 (2013).  \n\nThe Board must consider that when there is an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence regarding any issue material to the determination of a matter, the Secretary shall give the benefit of the doubt to the claimant. 38 U.S.C.A. § 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 3.102; see also Gilbert v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 49 (1990).\n\nThe Veteran seeks service connection for a left knee disability.  He claims that the left knee disability was incurred during his service, to specifically include an in-service left knee injury during boot camp training.  \n\nThe Veteran's service treatment records are negative for complaints, treatments, or diagnoses related to any knee disorder.  \n\nPost-service treatment records reveal complaints of bilateral knee pain and an October 2007 diagnosis of knee arthralgia.  A February 2016 DBQ report reflects diagnosis of degenerative arthritis of the left knee. \n\nIn a November 2013 statement from the Veteran, the Veteran reported that he injured his left knee during his service during a drill and that he did not seek treatment because he did not want to be viewed unfavorably by his drill instructors.  \n\nIn a January 2014 statement from the Veteran's brother, E.M.Y., the Veteran's brother reported that he saw the Veteran limping when he visited home for Christmas while on active duty.  In a January 2014 statement from the Veteran's brother, C.E.Y., the Veteran's brother reported that the Veteran described his in-service injury to the left knee.  \n\nDuring an October 2015 Board videoconference hearing, the Veteran testified that he was diagnosed with arthritis of the left leg about a year ago and recounted the left leg injury during service.  The Veteran reported that while in boot camp, the Veteran's left knee failed to turn during a drill and he collapsed.  The Veteran reported that he did not seek treatment for the left knee injury during service because he believed that being placed in sick bay would mean that he would be \"considered not a good person,\" that there was \"something wrong with [him].\"  The Veteran further testified that he felt \"okay on the leg\" after three days and that his left leg did not hurt him enough to seek treatment during service.  Post-service, the Veteran testified that \"as time went on,\" he realized that he \"could not walk the distances [he] had walked before.\"  The Veteran testified that he favors his right leg over his left leg.  \n\nA February 2016 DBQ reflects a diagnosis of degenerative arthritis of the left knee.  The DBQ report also reflects the Veteran's report that he injured his left knee in boot camp while marching during service.  The Veteran reported that he did not seek treatment for his left knee injury because he was afraid such would have a negative impact on potential for promotion.  The DBQ report also reflects that the Veteran reported he has been \"favoring his left knee during walking since then.\"  The examiner opined that the claimed left knee disability was less likely than not incurred in or caused by the claimed in-service injury.  As rationale, the examiner cited to medical literature and stated that degenerative arthritis usually \"starts at the age of 45 or more\" and that the Veteran was 21 or 22 by the time of discharge.  As such, \"it was not possible to get anybody degenerative arthritis at that age\" and that the degenerative arthritis was \"more likely from a part of generalized degeneration due to age.\"  Further, the examiner noted that while the Veteran has reported favoring his left knee, the examiner found such statement \"controversial\" because if he favored the left knee, he \"ha[d] to limp, but his gate [was] normal\" at the time of the DBQ examination.  \n\nBased on the foregoing, the preponderance of the evidence is against the Veteran's claim for service connection for a left knee disability.  \n\nThe Board has first considered whether service connection is warranted on a presumptive basis.  However, the clinical evidence of record fails to show that the Veteran manifested arthritis to a degree of 10 percent within the one year following his active duty service discharge in August 1962.  As such, presumptive service connection is not warranted for a left knee disability.  38 U.S.C.A. §§ 1101, 1112; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.307, 3.309; Walker, supra. \n\nRelevant to direct service connection, while the evidence of record indicates that the Veteran is diagnosed with degenerative arthritis of the left knee, the probative evidence of record demonstrates that such is not related to his service.  In this regard, the Board places great probative weight on the February 2016 DBQ examiner's opinion that the Veteran's degenerative arthritis of the left knee is less likely than not related to service, but rather was the result of aging.  This opinion had clear conclusions and supporting data, as well as a reasoned medical explanation connection the two.  See Nieves-Rodriguez, supra; Stefl, supra.  No contrary medical opinion is of record.  \n\nThe Board notes that the Veteran, as well as his two brothers, has contended that his current left knee disability is related to his service, to specifically include the in-service left knee injury during a drill.  Lay witnesses are competent to provide testimony or statements relating to symptoms or facts of events that the lay witness observed and is within the realm of his or her personal knowledge, but not competent to establish that which would require specialized knowledge or training, such as medical expertise.  Layno v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 465, 469-70 (1994).  Lay evidence may also be competent to establish medical etiology or nexus.  Davidson v. Shinseki, 581 F.3d 1313, 1316   (Fed. Cir. 2009).\n\nThe Veteran is credible to describe current symptoms such as knee pain and swelling.  As to the etiology of the degenerative arthritis of the left knee, the Board finds such subject matter to be complex in nature and beyond the competence of a lay person.  See Woehlaert v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 456 (2007) (although the claimant is competent in certain situations to provide a diagnosis of a simple condition such as a broken leg or varicose veins, the claimant is not competent to provide evidence as to more complex medical questions).  In this regard, knowledge of degeneration of bone in the knee as a result of marching during a drill involves a medical subject concerning an internal physical process extending beyond an immediately observable cause-and-effect relationship.  Thus, the Board accords the statements from the Veteran and his two brothers regarding the etiology of his degenerative arthritis of the left knee to have little probative value as they are not competent to opine on such complex medical questions.  Specifically, where the determinative issue is one of medical causation, only those with specialized medical knowledge, training, or experience are competent to provide evidence on the issue. See Jones v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 134, 137 (1994).  Additionally, the opinions of the VA examiner who has the necessary training and medical knowledge to competently speak to the issues at hand are highly probative. \n\nMoreover, the Veteran and his brothers have offered only conclusory statements regarding the relationship between his purported in-service knee injury and/or symptoms and his current degenerative arthritis of the left knee.  In contrast, the February 2016 DBQ examiner took into consideration all the relevant facts in providing an opinion, to include the type of the Veteran's purported in-service injury and/or symptoms and the current nature of his left knee disability.  Therefore, the Board accords greater probative weight to the February 2016 DBQ examiner's opinion. \n\nIn addition, in adjudicating this claim, the Board must assess not only competency of the Veteran's statements, but also their credibility.  See Buchanan v. Nicholson, 451 F.3d 1331   (Fed. Cir. 2006).  The Board notes that the Veteran testified during his October 2015 hearing that he experienced left knee pain since his service.  In weighing credibility, VA may consider interest, bias, inconsistent statements, bad character, internal inconsistency, facial plausibility, self-interest, consistency with other evidence of record, malingering, desire for monetary gain, and demeanor of the witness.  Caluza, supra.  In the instant case, the Board finds such statements to lack credibility as they are inconsistent with the other evidence of record and were made under circumstances indicating bias or interest and, therefore, accords no probative weight to such contentions. \n\nIn this regard, the Veteran did not report a history of left knee injury or other symptoms related to the knee, but reported detailed injury to his shoulder in his VA treatment records.  Specifically, while a May 2006 VA treatment record notes that the Veteran \"denie[d] any injury\" referable to his complaint of knee pain, the VA treatment record indicates the Veteran's detailed reports about injury to his hand and shoulders.  See September 2005 VA treatment note; May 2008 VA treatment note.  See Rucker v. Brown, 10 Vet. App. 67, 73 (1997) (ascribing heightened credibility to statements made to clinicians for the purpose of treatment); see also Williams v. Gov. of Virgin Islands, 271 F.Supp.2d 696, 702 (V.I.2003) (noting that statements made for the purpose of diagnosis or treatment \"are regarded as inherently reliable because of the recognition that one seeking medical treatment is keenly aware of the necessity for being truthful in order to secure proper care\"). Furthermore, while the Veteran testified during the October 2015 videoconference hearing that he favored the right knee, the February 2016 DBQ report reflects otherwise, noting that the Veteran reported favoring his left knee.  Therefore, in light of these inconsistent statements, the Board finds the Veteran's statements regarding his in-service onset of left knee symptoms to not be credible or probative.\n\nIn reaching this decision, the Board has considered the applicability of the benefit of the doubt doctrine.  However, the preponderance of the evidence is against the Veteran's claim of entitlement to service connection for a left knee disability.  As such, that doctrine is not applicable in the instant appeal, and his claim must be denied.  38 U.S.C.A. § 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 3.102; Gilbert, supra.\n\n\nORDER\n\nService connection for a left knee disability is denied. \n\n\n____________________________________________\nWAYNE M.

G., a friend of the Veteran\n\n\nATTORNEY FOR THE BOARD\n\nM. M. Lunger, Associate Counsel\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nThe Veteran served on active duty from July 1973 to July 1978.\n\nThis matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a November 2008 rating decision of the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO) in Montgomery, Alabama.\n\nIn April 2011, the Veteran testified at a hearing before the undersigned Veterans Law Judge (VLJ).  A transcript of the hearing is associated with the claims file.\n\nThe matter was previously remanded by the Board in August 2011, April 2014 and January 2016, when it was remanded for additional development.  The case has been returned to the Board for further appellate review.  \n\n\nFINDING OF FACT\n\nThe Veteran's schizophrenia had onset during his active service.\n\n\nCONCLUSION OF LAW\n\nThe criteria for service connection for schizophrenia have been met.  38 U.S.C.A. §§ 1110, 1131, 5107 (West 2014); 38 C.F.R. § 3.303 (2016).\n\n\nREASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION\n\nAs the Board is granting service connection for schizophrenia, which constitutes a full grant of the benefit sought on appeal, a discussion of VA's duties to notify and assist is not required.\n\nService connection may be established for disability resulting from personal injury suffered or disease contracted in the line of duty, or for aggravation of a preexisting injury suffered or disease contracted in line of duty, in the active military, naval, or air service.  38 U.S.C.A. §§ 1110, 1131.  Service connection may also be granted for any disease diagnosed after discharge, when all the evidence, including that pertinent to service, establishes that the disease was incurred in service.  38 C.F.R. § 3.303(d). \n\nTo establish service connection for a disability resulting from a disease or injury incurred in service, or to establish service connection based on aggravation in service of a disease or injury which pre-existed service, there must be (1) competent evidence of the current existence of the disability for which service connection is being claimed; (2) competent evidence of incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury in active service; and (3) competent evidence of a nexus or connection between the current disability and the disease or injury incurred or aggravated in service.  Horn v. Shinseki, 25 Vet. App. 231, 236 (2010); Davidson v. Shinseki, 581 F.3d 1313 (Fed. Cir. Sept. 14, 2009); cf. Gutierrez v. Principi, 19 Vet. App. 1, 5 (2004) (citing Hickson v. West, 12 Vet. App. 247, 253 (1999)).  In many cases, medical evidence is required to meet the requirement that the evidence be \"competent.\"  However, when a condition may be diagnosed by its unique and readily identifiable features, the presence of the disorder is not a determination \"medical in nature\" and is capable of lay observation.  Barr v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 303, 309 (2007).\n\nIn rendering a decision on appeal, the Board must analyze the credibility and probative value of the evidence, account for the evidence which it finds to be persuasive or unpersuasive, and provide the reasons for its rejection of any material evidence favorable to the claimant.  See Gabrielson v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 36, 39-40 (1994); Gilbert v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 49, 57 (1990).  When there is an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence regarding any issue material to the determination of a matter, the benefit of the doubt shall be given to the claimant.  38 U.S.C.A. § 5107(b).  When a reasonable doubt arises regarding service origin, such doubt will be resolved in the favor of the claimant.  Reasonable doubt is doubt which exists because of an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence which does not satisfactorily prove or disprove the claim.  38 C.F.R. § 3.102.  The question is whether the evidence supports the claim or is in relative equipoise, with the claimant prevailing in either event, or whether a fair preponderance of the evidence is against the claim, in which event the claim must be denied.  See Gilbert, 1 Vet. App. at 54.\n\nThe Veteran seeks service connection for a psychiatric disorder.  He asserts that the symptoms of nervousness and anxiety he experienced in service were manifestations of an acquired psychiatric disorder.\n\nThe Veteran's service treatment records (STRs) reflect treatment in September and October 1974 for complaints of his \"whole body falling asleep[,]\" as well as numbness and tingling in his hands and toes.  A March 1976 entry indicates the Veteran's mother referred him due to behavior he was exhibiting while at home - staying out most of the night, never staying still and stating he has a crawling sensation under his scalp.  In April 1976, the Veteran was evaluated and the clinician noted that his scores were of questionable validity.  The Veteran appeared to be confused and was asking for help.  The clinician noted that the Veteran had multiple problems but it was hard to determine a specific diagnosis due to confused test results.  The clinician stated \"[b]est guess is borderline leaning toward Schiz.  Consider possible drug abuse.\"  The Veteran's service personnel records also indicate he was subjected to a court martial in May 1978 due to a physical altercation he was involved in with his captain.\n\nThe Veteran's post-service VA medical treatment records show a diagnosis of schizophrenia in December 2006.  At that time, the Veteran reported he was violent and experienced outbursts approximately once a year.  The Veteran reported an incident where he had hit someone in the head with a bat and was taken to jail.  He also stated that while he was in service, he body slammed his captain.\n\nDuring his April 2011 Board hearing, the Veteran testified that he was treated for nervousness in service and that following service he continued to experience mental health issues, but did not seek treatment.  He testified that he was diagnosed with schizophrenia in 2005.\nThe Veteran underwent a VA mental disorders examination in September 2011.  The accompanying opinion, as well as the subsequent opinions obtained in June 2014 and January 2016, was deemed inadequate by the Board.  These inadequate, negative nexus opinions failed to consider the Veteran's lay statements regarding his in-service and post-service symptoms and failed to address his self-reported violent behavior.  Notably, these opinions relied on the absence of treatment for psychiatric symptoms for several years following the Veteran's discharge from service and the fact that he was not diagnosed with schizophrenia until 2006 in finding that the Veteran's schizophrenia was not related to his active service.\n\nTherefore the Board requested an opinion from a Veterans Health Administration (VHA) specialist in February 2017 as to whether it is at least as likely as not that the Veteran's current diagnosis of a psychiatric disorder, to include schizophrenia had is onset during service, or is otherwise related to the Veteran's service, including his reports of in-service nervousness and an evaluation for a nervous condition, and his lay statements regarding violent behavior in service.  An opinion was provided in May 2017 by a VA psychologist who conducted a thorough review of the Veteran's electronic file in conjunction with rendering the requested opinion.  The VHA specialist noted that the Veteran's service treatment records document that the Veteran was seen for mental health symptoms on several occasions during service.  The examiner noted that the Veteran's complaints of feeling numbness, tingling and crawling sensations \"may well have reflected the presence of tactile hallucination(s), one of the positive symptoms of Schizophrenia Spectrum Disorders.\"  The examiner also noted that the STRs reflect the Veteran's reports of heavy drinking of alcohol in service and stated that it is not uncommon for individuals, who for the first time, are experiencing the symptoms of a psychotic disorder to use alcohol and/or other substances in an attempt to self-medicate.  Additionally, the examiner acknowledged the incident in service which resulted in the Veteran's court martial proceedings - the Veteran's violent behavior toward his superior commissioned officer.  The VHA specialist stated that incidents such as these \"are consonant with decline in functioning frequently seen in persons with serious mental illnesses such as Schizophrenia and Schizophrenia Spectrum and other Psychotic Disorder.\"\n\nAs discussed above, the Board previously determined that the September 2011, June 2014 and January 2016 VA opinions were inadequate in part because the VA examiners relied on the Veteran's lack of treatment for psychiatric symptoms until many years after his discharge from service and did not consider the Veteran's lay statements regarding his symptoms.\n\nThe Board finds the May 2017 VHA medical expert opinion that the symptoms the Veteran experienced in service were at least as likely as not early manifestations of the Veteran's currently diagnosed schizophrenia was well reasoned and thoroughly considered the Veteran's complete medical history.  The VHA specialist opined after reviewing the medical records that it is as least as likely as not that the symptoms the Veteran experienced in service were early manifestations of schizophrenia.  This opinion is afforded high probative value.  See Prejean v. West, 13 Vet App. 444, 448-9 (2000) (a factor for assessing the probative value of a medical opinion includes the thoroughness and detail of the opinion).\n\nThus, given the probative opinion by the expert regarding the Veteran's schizophrenia and resolving all doubt in the Veteran's favor, the Board finds that service connection for an acquired psychiatric disorder, namely, schizophrenia is warranted.\n\n\nORDER\n\nService connection for schizophrenia is granted.\n\n\n\n\n____________________________________________\nKRISTI L.

Jordan, Counsel\n\n                           INTRODUCTION\n\n    The veteran served from October 1940 to February 1944.\n\n    This matter came before the Board of Veterans' Appeals\n    (hereinafter the Board) on appeal from a rating decision\n    of February 1990, from the New York, New York, Regional\n    Office.  The notice of disagreement was received in\n    December 1990.  The statement of the case was issued in\n    February 1991.  The substantive appeal was received in\n    April 1991.  The appeal was received at the Board and\n    docketed in August 1991.  The appellant is represented by\n    the Disabled American Veterans in this matter.\n\n                CONTENTIONS OF APPELLANT ON APPEAL\n\n    The appellant contends that the originating agency erred\n    in its determination that the veteran's service-connected\n    disabilities were not a material factor in his death.  It\n    is argued that he suffered for many years with his\n    disabilities and that the strain and stress from these\n    disabilities could have caused his death by myocardial\n    infarction.\n\n                       DECISION OF THE BOARD\n\n    For the reasons and bases hereinafter set forth, it is the\n    decision of the Board that the preponderance of the\n    evidence is against the appellant's claim for service\n    connection for the cause of the veteran's death.\n\n                         FINDINGS OF FACT\n\n    1.  The veteran's death in December 1989 was due to\n    circumferential myocardial infarctions and severe coronary\n    arteriosclerosis.\n\n    2.  At the time of the veteran's death, service connection\n    was in effect for duodenal ulcer with postoperative hiatus\n    hernia, assigned a 60 percent, and depressive neurosis,\n    assigned a 30 percent evaluation.\n\n    3.  Myocardial infarction and coronary arteriosclerosis\n    were first demonstrated many years after the veteran's\n    military service.\n\n    4.  The veteran's service-connected disabilities did not cause\n    the development of myocardial infarction or coronary\n    arteriosclerosis and were not factors which contributed to his\n    death.\n\n                           CONCLUSIONS OF LAW\n\n    1.  Cardiovascular disease was not incurred in or aggravated by\n    service and may not be presumed to have been incurred in\n    service.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1101, 1110, 1112, 1113; 38 C.F.R.\n    §§ 3.307, 3.309.\n\n    2.  Cardiovascular disease was not proximately due to or the\n    result of service-connected disability.  38 C.F.R. § 3.310(a).\n\n    3.  A service-connected disability did not contribute\n    substantially or materially to cause death.  38 U.S.C. § 1210;\n    38 C.F.R. § 3.312.\n\n             REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS\n\n    Initially, we note that we have found that the veteran's claim\n    is \"well grounded\" within the meaning of 38 U.S.C. § 5107(a).\n    That is, we find that she has presented a claim which is not\n    implausible.  Further, after reviewing the record, we are\n    satisfied that all the relevant facts have been fully developed\n    and that the case is properly in appellate status.\n\n    The basic facts of this case are not in dispute.  The veteran\n    died in December 1989.  The certificate of death shows that the\n    veteran's death was due to myocardial infarction due to severe\n    coronary arteriosclerosis.  His death was in a private\n    residence.  The autopsy report showed circumferential\n    myocardial infarctions, severe coronary arteriosclerosis,\n    occlusion of the right coronary artery with recent hemorrhage\n    into an arteriosclerotic plaque, and systemic arteriosclerosis,\n    severe, with occlusion of the left iliac artery.  A history of\n    carcinoma of the esophagus was also reported.  It was noted\n    that he was status post partial gastrectomy for perforated\n    ulcer, which was remote in time and well healed.  It was\n    concluded that the veteran, with a history of arteriosclerotic\n    vascular disease and carcinoma of the esophagus, died as a\n    result of acute myocardial infarction, superimposed upon healed\n    and scarred myocardial infarction.\n\n    At the time of the veteran's death, service connection was in\n    effect for duodenal ulcer with postoperative hiatus hernia,\n    assigned a 60 percent evaluation, and depressive neurosis\n    secondary to ulcer disease, assigned a 30 percent evaluation.\n    A 100 percent evaluation was in effect from March 1977.  The\n    appellant has been awarded dependency and indemnity\n    compensation benefits under 38 U.S.C. § 1318.\n\n    To establish service connection for the cause of the veteran's\n    death, the evidence must show that disability incurred in or\n    aggravated by service either caused or contributed\n    substantially or materially to cause death.  For a\n    service-connected disability to be the cause of death, it must\n    singly or with some other condition be the immediate or\n    underlying cause, or be etiologically related.  For a\n    service-connected disability to constitute a contributory\n    cause, it is not sufficient to show that it casually shared in\n    producing death, but rather it must be shown that there was a\n    causal connection.  38 U.S.C. § 1310; 38 C.F.R. § 3.312.\n\n    Under the law, service connection for cardiovascular disease\n    may be established if it is shown to have been incurred in or\n    aggravated by service or within one year following the\n    veteran's separation from service.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1101, 1110,\n    1112, 1113; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.307, 3.309.  Service connection may\n    also be established if it is shown that a disability is the\n    result of or proximately due to service-connected disability.\n    38 C.F.R. § 3.310(a).\n\n    The evidence does not show that the veteran had cardiovascular\n    disease until many years after his military service, and it is\n    not otherwise contended.  The service medical records are\n    negative for findings of, treatment for, or diagnosis of\n    cardiovascular disease.  The report of the Department of\n    Veterans Affairs (hereinafter VA) examination in February 1947\n    reflects normal cardiovascular findings.  An elevated blood\n    pressure reading was noted at the time of the hospitalization\n    of the veteran in April 1963.  Subsequent records also reflect\n    elevated blood pressure readings.\n\n    It is argued that the veteran's service-connected disabilities\n    may have resulted in stress and strain which led to the\n    development of cardiovascular disease.  While stress may have\n    an effect on an individual's blood pressure readings, it is not\n    established that it causes cardiovascular disease.  The\n    evidence shows that the veteran had severe arteriosclerosis.\n    Arteriosclerosis is defined as \"sclerosis and thickening of the\n    walls of the smaller arteries\"  Dorland's Illustrated Medical\n    Dictionary 143 (25th ed. 1974).  Generally, the development of\n    cardiovascular disease is multifactorial.\n\n             In about 99% of cases, coronary artery\n             disease is due to atherosclerotic\n             changes.  Other causes include syphilis,\n             various forms of arteritis, coronary\n             embolism, and connective tissue\n             disorders   Atherosclerosis is an\n             age-related degenerative process,\n             occurring with increasing frequency with\n             advancing age.  It is not inevitable,\n             because some octogenarians have minimal or\n             no evidence of coronary atherosclerosis on\n             postmortem examination, but the reason for\n             its absence in these people is\n             unknown...The major risk factors are age,\n             a family history of atherosclerosis,\n             hyperlipidemia, male gender, hypertension,\n             diabetes, and cigarette smoking.  Less\n             important factors are the use of oral\n             contraceptives and prostaglandin\n             imbalance.  Controversial factors are\n             physical inactivity, personality, and\n             sociocultural factors, and prostacyclin\n             deficiency...Combinations of risk factors\n             greatly enhance the probability of a\n             cardiovascular event.  M. Sokolow, M. B.\n             McIlroy, M. D. Chietlin, Clinical\n             Cardiology, 145, 147 (Fifth Ed., 1990)\n\n    There is no evidence that the veteran's organic\n    cardiovascular disease was caused by his service-connected\n    disabilities.  Moreover, it is not shown that his\n    service-connected disabilities resulted in debilitation or\n    general impairment of health which would render him less\n    capable of resisting the disease which was the primary cause\n    of his death.  The autopsy report reflects status post\n    partial gastrectomy for perforated ulcer, which was\n    described as remote in time and well healed.\n\n    Accordingly, we do not find that the veteran's death may be\n    said to have been the result of service-connected\n    disability.\n\n                                ORDER\n\n    Service connection for the cause of the veteran's death is\n    denied.\n\n                     BOARD OF VETERANS' APPEALS\n                       WASHINGTON, D.C. 20420\n\n        C.

Grossman\n\nATTORNEY FOR THE BOARD\n\nL. B. Wirt, Associate Counsel\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nThe veteran served on active duty in the Air Force from\nOctober 1967 to October 1969.  He also served in the Air\nNational Guard from January to May 1966.\n\nThis appeal arises from a March 1990 rating decision of the\nDepartment of Veterans Affairs (VA) Seattle, Washington,\nRegional Office (RO), which denied the veteran entitlement to\nservice connection for post-traumatic stress disorder.  This\ncase was remanded by the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board)\nin March 1992 and June 1994.\n\nCONTENTIONS OF APPELLANT ON APPEAL\n\nThe veteran contends that he suffers from post-traumatic\nstress disorder as a result of his experiences in service at\nthe Cam Rahn Bay Air Base in the Republic of Vietnam.  His\nclaimed stressors include his general duties loading weapons\nonto airplanes, experiencing several mortar and rocket\nattacks on the base, and having many friends killed or\nwounded by enemy fire.  He contends that he experiences night\nsweats, nightmares and flashbacks from these events.\n\nDECISION OF THE BOARD\n\nThe Board, in accordance with the provisions of 38 U.S.C.A.\n§ 7104 (West 1991), has reviewed and considered all of the\nevidence and material of record in the veteran's claims file.\nBased on its review of the relevant evidence in this matter,\nand for the following reasons and bases, it is the decision\nof the Board that the preponderance of the evidence is\nagainst the grant of entitlement to service connection for\npost-traumatic stress disorder.\n\nFINDING OF FACT\n\nThe medical evidence does not establish a clear diagnosis of\npost traumatic stress disorder.\n\nCONCLUSION OF LAW\n\nPost-traumatic stress disorder was not incurred in or\naggravated by service, and nor may it be attributed to any\nincidents in service.  38 U.S.C.A. § 1110 (West 1991);\n38 C.F.R. §§ 3.303, 3.304(f) (1994).\n\nREASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION\n\nThe Board notes that the veteran's claim is well grounded\nwithin the meaning of 38 U.S.C.A. § 5107(a) (West 1991).  The\nBoard is also satisfied that all relevant facts have been\nproperly developed and that no further assistance to the\nveteran is required to comply with the statutory duty to\nassist mandated by 38 U.S.C.A. § 5107(a).\n\nThe veteran has appealed a denial of entitlement to service\nconnection for post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).\nService connection may be established for disabilities\nresulting from injury or disease incurred in or aggravated by\nservice.  38 U.S.C.A. § 1110; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303(a).  Under\n38 C.F.R. § 3.304(f), service connection for PTSD \"requires\nmedical evidence establishing a clear diagnosis of the\ncondition, credible supporting evidence that the claimed\ninservice stressor actually occurred, and a link, established\nby medical evidence, between current symptomatology and the\nclaimed inservice stressor.\"\n\nThe veteran's service medical records are negative for\nevidence of a psychiatric condition of any kind.  They are\nalso negative for any evidence of combat-related injuries.\n\nThe veteran has been scheduled for VA examinations for\nevaluation of his psychiatric condition four times since\nfiling his original application for compensation in July\n1987.  The first examination was scheduled for September\n1987.  After he failed to report, he submitted a statement\nindicating that he had been unable to obtain transportation\nto the examination.  He requested to be rescheduled.  The\nexamination was rescheduled for February 1988, but he again\nfailed to report.  He claimed that he had been unable to\nreport due to the severity of his disability.  Pursuant to\nthe Board's March 1992 remand, the veteran was scheduled for\nanother VA examination in November 1992.  He failed to report\nand offered no excuse.  He also failed to report to the VA\nexamination scheduled for January 1995, pursuant to the\nBoard's June 1994 remand, and again offered no excuse.  Under\n38 C.F.R. § 3.655(b), when a veteran fails to report for a\nscheduled VA examination in the course of an original claim,\nthe claim shall be rated on the evidence of record.\n\nThe veteran submitted a statement in March 1990 describing\nhis claimed inservice stressors.  He stated that he was\nstationed at Cam Rahn Bay Air Base in Vietnam in 1968 and\n1969 with the \"415th\" Munitions Maintenance Squadron, and\nthat his job involved loading bombs and rockets on aircraft.\nHe stated that any mistake would have meant an explosion, and\nclaimed this as one of his stressors.  He also stated that he\nfelt guilty knowing that the bombs he loaded would be used to\nkill innocent civilians.  He noted that bombs and rockets\nwere loaded while radar was in operation, which, according to\nhim, could have caused the rockets to go off.  He also noted\nthat \"gas bombs\" were loaded without dispersant, which \"could\nhave wiped out [his] whole unit.\"  In addition, he reported\nthat the base sustained rocket attacks while bombs were being\nloaded, and that one time shrapnel was showered all over the\nplane on which he was working.  He stated that since\nreturning he has had frequent nightmares of Vietnam, and\nsometimes wakes up in a cold sweat.  During the Tet Offensive\nof 1968, he claimed that the base was under rocket attack\nevery night.  He stated that the most terrifying part of this\nwas the randomness of the attacks.\n\nThe veteran's substantive appeal, received at the RO in April\n1991, further details his claimed stressors.  He reiterated\nthat he was in constant danger of an explosion because he was\nhandling ordnance.  He also stated that the Cam Rahn Bay Air\nBase was under frequent rocket and mortar attack all during\n1968 and 1969, but was unable to recall specific dates\nbecause the attacks were \"too many and too frequent.\"  He\nstated that although he was lucky not to be injured or killed\nin these attacks, many of those he served with were killed\nand wounded.  He also noted again that rocket attacks\noccurred \"every night\" during the 1968 Tet.\n\nPursuant to the Board's June 1994 remand, the RO sent two\nletters to the veteran, in July and December 1994, requesting\nadditional information regarding his claimed stressors, such\nas the specific months or dates of the claimed rocket attacks\nand the names and circumstances surrounding the casualties\nand deaths he had mentioned.  It was also noted in these\nletters that the transcript of his August 1991 personal\nhearing was not in his file.  He was asked to submit a copy\nof this transcript if such was in his possession.  The\nDecember 1994 letter also asked him whether he desired\nanother hearing.  He did not respond to either of these\nletters.\n\nThe veteran's service personnel records indicate that he\nserved in Vietnam from August 1968 to August 1969 as a\nWeapons Mechanic at the Cam Rahn Bay Air Base as part of the\n559th Tactical Fighter Squadron (TFS) and the 412th Munitions\nMaintenance Squadron (MMS).  He was awarded the National\nDefense Service Medal and the Vietnam Service Medal.\n\nThe RO contacted the U.S. Army and Joint Services\nEnvironmental Support Group (ESG) for verification of the\nveteran's claimed stressors.  A response from this\norganization was received at the RO in August 1992, wherein\nit was indicated that general histories were not provided for\nlarge periods of time without a specific incident.  The\nresponse noted that histories of the veteran's unit in\nVietnam could be requested from the U.S. Air Force Historical\nResearch Center, Maxwell Air Force Base, Alabama.  A request\nto this organization for unit histories yielded a roll of\nmicrofilm containing histories and other documents pertaining\nto the 12th Tactical Fighter Wing, of which the 559th TFS and\nthe 412th MMS were part.\n\nThe documents on the microfilm do not contain extensive\ninformation about individual experiences.  They reflect\nconcern with safety procedures to insure that explosive\naccidents/incidents were properly reported.  They also show\nthat there were explosive mishaps at Cam Rahn Bay Air Base in\nlate 1968.  Specific references to the 559th TFS include\nnotations that an F-4C aircraft was lost, but the crew\nrecovered, on August 31, 1968; and that an F-4C aircraft was\nlost and the crew killed in action on November 13, 1968.\nReferences to the 412th MMS consist mainly of information as\nto the changes made in physical facilities, procedures and\noperational processes used by the squadron.  It was noted\nthat there were no major explosive accidents during the\nperiod of July 1 to September 30, 1968, and that the M-121\n10,000-pound bomb was added to the squadron's munitions\ninventory during the month of October 1968.\n\nAs regards rocket and mortar fire sustained at Cam Rahn Bay\nAir Base, the historical documents of the 12th Tactical\nFighter Wing do not indicate that any such attacks occurred\nduring the period of July 1 to December 31, 1968, or from\nApril 1 to June 30, 1969.  A brief chronology of the period\nJanuary 1 to March 31, 1969, indicates rocket and mortar\nattacks on January 4, February 23 and March 21.  Another\nsection details these attacks, and indicates that the\nJanuary 4 attack occurred at the Combined Tactical Operations\nCenter (COTC) in the Republic of Korea (ROK) compound, and\nconsisted of 18 rounds of 82 mm mortar fire.  There was no\nreported equipment damage, but one ROK soldier was wounded in\naction.  It is unclear from the report whether the ROK\ncompound was considered part of the Cam Rahn Bay Air Base.\nIt was reported that there was increase with respect to enemy\nstand-off attacks of rockets and mortars compared to the\nprevious nine months.\n\nOn February 23, 1969, Cam Rahn Bay Air Base was hit with\nseven 140 mm enemy rounds, causing light damage and wounding\nthree Air Force personnel with shrapnel.  No aircraft were\ndestroyed, but six planes sustained light damage.  A C-130\nhangar received moderate damage from shrapnel, which included\ndamage to some electronics testing equipment located in the\nbuilding.  A Combat Operations After Action Report on this\nincident indicates that no one was killed or missing in\naction.  This report also notes that this was the first\nenemy-initiated attack directed at the Cam Rahn Bay Air Base\nsince March 1968.  On March 21, 1969, a perimeter post on the\nbay side of the base reported incoming rounds impacting in\nthe bay in front of his post.  A short time later, a sentry\ndog post reported an additional two rounds had impacted in a\nmangrove swamp on the edge of the peninsula, and two\nobservation posts reported incoming small arms fire from the\nmainland.  It was later surmised that these attacks were\ndiversionary tactics during a stand-off attack on the Army\n92nd Assault Helicopter Company located at Dong Ba Thin, just\nacross the bay from the Air Base.\n\nA brief chronology for the period of July 1 to September 30,\n1969, indicates that Cam Rahn Bay Air Base was subjected to\nenemy stand-off rocket attacks on July 8, August 7 and\nSeptember 6.  It was noted to be the first time in the\nhistory of the base that it had been subjected to such\nattacks on a monthly basis, and that there was little effect\non either men or equipment.  The first two rounds of the July\nattack were 140 mm rockets, and impacted approximately 150\nmeters southwest of the 412th MMS ammunition preload and\nholding areas.  Ten 107 mm rockets impacted on the bay side\nof the base.  There were no injuries or Air Force property\ndamaged as a direct result of this attack.\n\nThe August 1969 attack consisted of seven confirmed impact\npoints along the west side of the taxiway, one at the F-4C\nalert facility, one at the HH-43 helicopter pad, one at the\nTACAN site, one at the 12th Civil Engineering work yard area,\nfour at the Naval Air Facility located on the west side of\nthe Air Base, and four in the My Ca village located adjacent\nto the Naval Air Facility.  In all a total of 22 rounds were\nconfirmed and identified as 107 mm rockets.  Reported damage\nto Air Force property was: eight C-130 aircraft with light\nskin damage (flyable); one C-123 aircraft with Jet assist\nengine damage (unflyable); one maintenance vehicle with minor\ndamage; and one building with minor damage.  One Air Force\nperson was wounded in action, and there was one indirect\ninjury as a result of the attack.  As indicated in his\nservice personnel records, the veteran was no longer\nstationed at Cam Rahn Bay at the time of the September 1969\nattack.\n\nThe veteran has had numerous psychological evaluations\npursuant to a claim with the Social Security Administration.\nThese various evaluations reflect diagnoses of PTSD, along\nwith chronic alcohol dependence/abuse, anti-social\npersonality features, anxiety, depression and dysthymia.\nSome of these evaluations indicate that a diagnosis of PTSD\nis questionable, and suggest that alcohol abuse is his\npredominant problem.  He was awarded Social Security\ndisability benefits due to anxiety disorder, personality\ndisorder and substance addiction disorder.  These evaluations\ninclude one in January 1988 by Hayyim Grossman, MA/PHC, in\nwhich it was reported that the veteran had been “constantly\nexposed to life threatening situations in loading, unloading,\narming and de-arming aircraft.”  The diagnosis was post\ntraumatic stress disorder.  In February 1992, Mr. Grossman\nreported that the psychosocial stressors for a diagnosis of\npost traumatic stress disorder were “constant vivid recall of\nwitnessing death, dying and rocket/motor [sic] attacks in\nVietnam.”\n\nThe Board has carefully reviewed the entire claims file.  The\nrecord does not show through recognized military citations or\nother supportive evidence that the veteran was “engaged in\ncombat with the enemy.” He has, however, claimed that he was\nexposed to stressors which include: (1) performing inherently\ndangerous work loading munitions onto bombers; (2) exposure\nto frequent rocket and mortar attacks; and (3) death or\ninjury of service comrades.  His squadron assignments and his\nduty title are consistent with his claim that he was required\nto handle various munitions as part of his work.  Service\nrecords also provide support for his claim as to the inherent\ndangers of his work.  As to the claimed rocket and mortar\nattacks, the service records do show that Cam Rahn Bay Air\nBase was subjected to such attacks, although not at the\nfrequency alleged.  Service records also document the death\nand injury of service comrades.  Thus, record provides\ngeneral, although not specific, corroboration of stressful\nevents in service.  The record also includes medical evidence\nlinking the diagnosis of post traumatic stress disorder to\nthe claimed in-service stressors.\n\nAt this point, the Board will not address question of the\nsufficiency of the evidence as to the alleged stressors or\nthe medical linkage because the remaining requirement to\nestablish service connection for post traumatic stress\ndisorder according to 38 C.F.R. § 3.304 (f) is not present.\nNamely, the “clear diagnosis” of post traumatic stress\ndisorder.  As was observed previously, the clinical evidence\nsubmitted in support of the claim includes a number of\npsychiatric diagnoses.  The veteran has repeatedly failed to\nreport for the VA examinations which have been scheduled for\nthe specific purpose of determining the proper diagnosis or\ndiagnoses, and in doing so, reconciling the diagnostic\ninconsistencies in the record.  Because all the requirements\nnecessary to service connect post traumatic stress disorder\nare not met, the evidence preponderates against the claim.\n\nORDER\n\nService connection for post-traumatic stress disorder is\ndenied.\n\n          NANCY I.

Miyake, Associate Counsel\n\n\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nThe veteran had active military service from December 1948 to \nJanuary 1952.  He served as a combat medic during the Korean \nConflict.\n\nThis appeal is before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) \nfrom a September 1996 rating decision of the Huntington, West \nVirginia Regional Office (RO) of the Department of Veterans \nAffairs (VA) which denied the benefit sought.  The veteran \ntestified at a personal hearing in January 1997.  In a \nFebruary 1997 decision, the hearing officer confirmed the \ndenial and issued a supplemental statement of the case.  In \nJanuary 1998, he canceled a request for a hearing before a \nMember of the Board.  In May 1998, the Board remanded the \ncase for further development.\n\n\nFINDINGS OF FACT\n\n1. All relevant evidence necessary for an equitable \ndisposition of the veteran's appeal has been obtained.\n\n2. The veteran served in combat in Korea and experienced cold \nexposure in service.\n\n3. The evidence supports a finding that he has residuals of \nfrozen feet which are causally related to his exposure to \ncold in service.\n\n\nCONCLUSION OF LAW\n\nResiduals of frozen feet were incurred in service.  \n38 U.S.C.A. §§ 1110, 5107 (West 1991 & Supp. 1998); 38 C.F.R. \n§ 3.303 (1998).\n\n\nREASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSION\n\nI.  Factual Background\n\nService medical records, including the veteran's enlistment \nand separation examination reports, are negative for \ncomplaint of, treatment for, or a diagnosis of frostbite.\n\nService records show that the veteran's awards/decorations \nincluded the Purple Heart medal.  His military occupational \nspecialty was a medical aidman.\n\nVA outpatient treatment reports from August 1994 to \nJanuary 1997 show that in September 1995, bilateral dorsalis \npedis was noted.  In October 1995, he was seen for complaints \nof left heel pain.  Examination of the extremities was \nunremarkable.\n\nOn VA PTSD examination in July 1996, the veteran gave a \nhistory of serving in Korea.  He reported incurring frozen \nfeet causing his toenails to fall off.  He stated that he has \ntrouble with his feet, and has difficulty walking.  \n\nOn VA examination for systemic conditions in July 1996, the \nveteran gave a history of frostbite in 1951 while serving in \nKorea.  Current complaints included mycotic toenails, \nnumbness with cold feet, cyanosis of the feet when sitting \nfor a long period of time, and foot pain.  Examination of the \nextremities revealed mycotic toenails, no deformity, and no \nedema.  The diagnoses included residuals of frostbite.\n\nAt a hearing before the RO in January 1997, the veteran \ntestified that while serving in combat in Korea he was \nexposed to cold weather for long periods of time and incurred \nfrostbite on several occasions.  He stated that because he \nwas a medical technician and capable of treating his own \nfeet, he did not seek treatment or complain about his feet to \nanyone else.  He testified that he has never sought treatment \nfor his feet but has always self medicated them.  He also \ntestified that his brother could confirm that he had \nfrostbite in service.  His wife testified that the veteran \nalways had trouble with his toenails falling off and that he \ntold her that he had frostbite in Korea.  She testified that \nhe uses over-the-counter medication to treat his feet.  \n\nLay statements received in January 1997 from the veteran's \nbrother-in-law, and two sisters attest to the fact that he \nhad frostbite in Korea.  A lay statement from the veteran's \nbrother attests to the fact that he also served in Korea and \nthat the veteran suffered from frostbite in Korea.  \n\nOn VA cold injury protocol examination in June 1998, the \nveteran gave a history of frostbite of both feet in Korea in \n1949.  He reported working as a medical assistant in the \nfield exposed the full winter.  He stated cold sensitization, \nRaynaud's phenomenon, paresthesia, and numbness were present.  \nHe reported recurrent fungal infection, disturbance of nail \ngrowth, arthritis and joint stiffness, occasional stiffness \nof the toes, edema, bluish discoloration, skin thinning, and \ncold feet in both winter and summer.  He noted sharp, burning \npain at the toes and anterior aspect of the feet, moderate to \nsevere, precipitated by cold, walking, or standing.  He also \nnoted having night pain which was sharp and burning in \ncharacter.  He reported wearing multiple layers of socks.  \nExamination of the skin revealed evidence of fungus \ninfection, mycotic toenails, and bluish discoloration.  The \nfeet were cold.  No ulcerations were noted.  Neurological \nexamination revealed reflexes wereintact.  There were \nsubjective complaints of pain and numbness, sensation to \npinprick was intact, there were weakness of lower extremities \nand feet, no atrophy, stiffness in all toes, occasional \nswelling, limited toe movement especially the great toes, and \npain on manipulation of the joints.  The diagnoses included \nresiduals of frostbite of both feet.\n\nOn VA examination of the feet in June 1998, the veteran gave \na history of serving as a medic in Korea.  Current complaints \nincluded increased pain in the feet, difficulty walking \nbecause of pain, and difficulty bending his great toes due to \npain.  He reported occasional discoloration of his feet \nespecially in cold weather.  He noted his feet fatigue faster \nwith more pain and lack of endurance.  He also noted he could \nnot walk on carpeted floors without shoes on because of \ndiscomfort.  He noted walking helps relieve some of his foot \npain and that he is currently taking Motrin, which relieves \nsome of his symptoms.  He reported increased problems with \ncold weather, walking on uneven surfaces, or prolonged \nwalking.  Physical examination revealed he was able to remove \nhis shoes and socks, but had extreme difficulty in walking \nthe three feet from his chair to the examining table to get \nup on it.  He had apparent pain.  On examination, he was very \ntender across the metatarsal heads, especially of the great \ntoe, worse to the left than the right on palpation.  \n\nOn range of motion with goniometer, the MP joint of the right \ngreat toe showed plantar flexion to 15 degrees and extension \nto 40 degrees.  The DIP joint of the great toe could not do \nplantar flexion but could extend to 25 degrees.  The 2nd toe \nMP joint could plantar flex to 20 degrees and extend to 45 \ndegrees from neutral.  The PIP joint was 0 degrees extension \nand 25 degrees plantar flexion.  The DIP joint was 0 degrees \nextension and 20 degrees plantar flexion.  On the 3rd toe, he \nhad 15 degrees of plantar flexion and 45 degrees of \nextension.  The PIP joint revealed 0 degrees of extension and \n30 degrees of plantar flexion.  The DIP joint was 0 degrees \nof extension and 20 degrees of plantar extension.  The 4th \ntoe of the right foot had 10 degrees of plantar flexion and \n40 degrees of extension on the MP joint.  The PIP joint was 0 \ndegrees of extension and 30 degrees of plantar flexion.  The \nDIP joint was 0 degrees extension and 15 degrees of plantar \nflexion.  The 5th toe of the right foot MP joint had 20 \ndegrees of plantar flexion and 40 degrees of extension.  The \nPIP joint had 0 degrees of extension and 35 degrees of \nplantar flexion.  The DIP joint had 0 degrees of extension \nand 15 degrees of plantar flexion.  The left foot great toe \nMP joint had 15 degrees of plantar flexion and 30 degrees of \nextension.  It was very painful to any motion of this joint.  \nThe DIP joint was 0 degrees of extension and 15 degrees of \nplantar flexion.  The 2nd toe had 0 degrees of plantar \nflexion and 60 degrees of extension on the PIP joint.  There \nwas 0 degrees of extension and 30 degrees of plantar flexion.  \nThe DIP had 0 degrees of extension and 10 degrees of flexion.  \nThe 3rd toe had 0 degrees of plantar flexion and 50 degrees \nof extension.  The PIP joint had 0 degrees of extension and \n35 degrees of plantar flexion.  The DIP joint had 0 degrees \nof extension and 5 degrees of plantar flexion.  The 4th toe \nMP joint had 0 degrees of plantar flexion and 50 degrees of \nextension.  The PIP joint had 0 degrees of extension and 30 \ndegrees of plantar flexion.  The DIP joint had 0 degrees of \nextension and 10 degrees of plantar flexion.  The 5th toe of \nthe left foot had 0 degrees of plantar flexion and 50 degrees \nof extension.  The PIP joint had 0 degrees of extension and \n50 degrees of flexion.  The DIP joint of the 5th toe was \nfused.  There was minimal lateral deviation of the great toes \nbilaterally.  Otherwise, there were no gross deformities or \nevidence of flat feet.  There was no evidence of \ndiscoloration or gross temperature changes to either foot.  \nOn examination of lower extremities, there was hair loss on \nthe distal third of both legs.  Posterior tibial and dorsalis \npedis pulses were good.  The veteran could stand with his \nshoes on with minimal difficulty.  He could rock up on his \ntoes with a great deal of effort, but could not stand on his \ntoes for even more than a couple of seconds.  He could not \nwalk on his toes at all.  This was due to pain  He could not \nrock back on his heels or walk on his heels due to \nincoordination.  X-rays of the feet revealed a plantar \ncalcaneal spur of each foot.  Both feet were otherwise \nessentially normal.  Peripheral vascular disease of the lower \nextremities secondary by the [veteran's] history to frostbite \nwas diagnosed.  The examiner noted that there was no mention \nof frostbite in the veteran's service records and no mention \nof gross changes to his feet in other examinations.  The \nexaminer opined that from previous experience and history \ngiven by the veteran, as relayed through his wife, the \npossibility of frostbite is quite possible.  \n\nII.  Analysis\n\nThe veteran's claim of service connection for residuals of \nfrozen feet is \"well grounded\" within the meaning of \n38 U.S.C.A. § 5107(a).  It is plausible.  See Murphy v. \nDerwinski, 1 Vet. App. 78, 81 (1990).  Furthermore, after \nreviewing the record, the Board is satisfied that all \nrelevant facts have been properly developed and no further \nassistance to the veteran is required to comply with the duty \nto assist mandated by 38 U.S.C.A. § 5107(a).\n\nFor a well-grounded claim of service connection, there must \nbe competent evidence of a current disability (a medical \ndiagnosis), of inservice incurrence or aggravation of a \ndisease or injury (lay or medical evidence), and of a nexus \nbetween the inservice injury or disease and the current \ndisability (medical evidence).  Caluza v. Brown, \n7 Vet. App. 498, 506 (1995), aff'd per curiam, 78 F.3d 604 \n(Fed. Cir. 1996) (table); see also Epps v. Gober, 126 F.3d \n1464, 1468 (Fed. Cir. 1997).\n\nService connection is warranted for disability resulting from \ndisease or injury that either began in or was aggravated by \nservice.  38 U.S.C.A. §§ 1110, 1131; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303(a).  \nAlternatively, under 38 C.F.R. § 3.303(b), service connection \nmay be awarded for a \"chronic\" condition when: (1) a \nchronic disease manifests itself and is identified as such in \nservice (or within the presumptive period under 38 C.F.R. \n§ 3.307) and the veteran presently has the same condition; or \n(2) a disease manifests itself during service (or during the \npresumptive period) but is not identified until later, there \nis a showing of continuity of symptomatology after discharge, \nand the medical evidence relates the symptomatology to the \nveteran's present condition.  Rose v. West, 11 Vet. App. 169 \n(1998); See Savage v. Gober, 10 Vet. App. 488, 495-98 (1997).  \nService connection may also be granted for a disease \ndiagnosed after service discharge when all evidence \nestablishes that the disease was incurred in service.  \n38 C.F.R. § 3.303(d).\n\nSatisfactory lay or other evidence that an injury or disease \nwas incurred or aggravated in combat will be accepted as \nsufficient proof of service connection if the evidence is \nconsistent with the circumstances, conditions or hardships of \nsuch service even though there is no official record of such \nincurrence or aggravation.  38 U.S.C.A. § 1154(b); 38 C.F.R. \n§ 3.304(d); Russo v. Brown, 9 Vet. App 46 (1996).  The Board \nnotes that 38 U.S.C.A. § 1154(b) only pertains to what may \nhave occurred during combat in service; medical evidence of a \nnexus between the current disability and the disease or \ninjury in combat is still required for a well-grounded claim.  \nLibertine v. Brown, 9 Vet. App. 521, 524 (1996).\n\nEvidentiary assertions by the veteran must be accepted as \ntrue for the purposes of determining whether a claim is well \ngrounded, except where the evidentiary assertion is \ninherently incredible or when the fact asserted is beyond the \ncompetence of the person making the assertion.  King v. \nBrown, 5 Vet. App. 19, 21 (1993).  If a reasonable doubt \narises regarding service origin, or any other point, it \nshould be resolved in the veteran's favor.  38 U.S.C.A. \n§ 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 3.102.\n\nThe veteran seeks service connection for residuals of frozen \nfeet, which he claims was caused by exposure to cold weather \nduring combat in Korea.  The Board notes that there is no \nquestion that the veteran currently has the disorder at \nissue.  According to a VA examiner in June 1998, the veteran \nhas a history of frostbite with residuals.\n\nService medical records do not show any evidence of \nfrostbite.  The veteran's separation examination reflects \nthat his feet were normal and no complaints of frozen feet \nwere reported.  Nevertheless, even though there was no \nofficial service record showing treatment for frozen feet \nduring service, the veteran participated in combat operations \nduring the Korean Conflict and the Board accepts his \nstatements and testimony that he was exposed to cold weather \nduring service.  38 U.S.C.A. § 1154(b); 38 C.F.R. § 3.304(d); \nRusso, supra.\n\nThe veteran must still show a nexus between the in-service \ninjury and his current disability.  Service medical records \nare silent and the record did not contain evidence that the \nveteran complained of or sought treatment for frozen feet \nuntil nearly 44 years after service.  While symptomatology \nwas negligible over the years, the Board finds that the \nveteran's reported exposure to cold weather in service, and \nthe medical opinions of VA doctors, provide adequate \ninformation on which to base a finding that the veteran's \ncurrent residuals of frozen feet is related to service.  \nTherefore, based on all the evidence of record, and according \nthe veteran any reasonable doubt remaining, the Board \nconcludes that the veteran's residuals of frostbite of the \nfeet were incurred in service.  \n\nAccordingly, the Board, based on its review of the relevant \nevidence in this matter, finds that the evidence is in \nrelative equipoise as to the merits of the veteran's claim.  \nWhen the evidence is in equipoise, the benefit of the doubt \nin resolving each issue shall be given to the claimant. 38 \nU.S.C.A. § 5107 (b); Gilbert v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 49, 54 \n(1990).  The Board finds that the absence of medical records \ndemonstrating frozen feet for nearly 44 years after service \nis counterbalanced by the positive findings and opinions of \nVA examiners, bringing the evidence regarding a nexus to \nservice at least into equipoise.  Therefore, in light of the \nforegoing, and granting the veteran the benefit of the doubt, \nthe Board concludes that residuals of frozen feet were \nrelated to active service.
